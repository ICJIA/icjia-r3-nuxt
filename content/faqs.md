  resources resources when i go to the r3 website there s a countdown to the
  application deadline however it seems to give me less time than there really
  is before the deadline of march 1 can you confirm the application due date the
  due date is march 1 at 2 00 p m cst there are only 28 days in february so the
  deadline may seem to be coming more quickly than expected please keep that in
  mind while finalizing your application for submission for the indirect cost
  rate we plan to include the 10 de minimus rate to the total application
  funding budget is that correct or is there a different required method to
  assign the indirect cost amount at 10 that s correct the budget should include
  the indirect cost the amount should be included in the budget request can you
  advise us on the budget category to which a particular cost should be assigned
  use your best judgment when assigning costs to each category grant
  applications will be reviewed for content not for inconsequential technical
  issues such as where budget items are assigned within the ways that the
  categories are listed in amplifund we are seeking clarity around the non grant
  funded and total budget sections is the intention for the expense budget for
  us to adjust our entire spending budget expenses for fy23 to be reflected
  within the state s budget categories salary fringe benefits supplies etc and
  then the total should reflect the amount we plan to spend in each of those
  areas in total i e the sum of the proposed grant funds plus anticipated non
  grant funded expenses similarly for the revenue budget are we to divide and
  include our overall organizational annual revenue projected for fy23 into the
  categories of the state our entire operating budget should be reflected within
  this budget please disregard non grant funded and revenue sections your
  application should only discuss grant expenditures to be made in the proposed
  program will we be asked to upload the budget worksheets in excel to our
  application if not will the agency approval ffata forms be in the application
  somewhere i have not seen them in there submit only the amplifund budget no
  other budget forms are requested or required when applying other forms will be
  required if your organization is selected for a grant are we able to ask for
  the full amount for our program costs or do we have to make cash and in kind
  contributions as well no cash or in kind match contributions are required for
  this program for the implementation schedule does this include tasks due dates
  for the implementation of the project or is this tasks due dates for once the
  program is implemented or both the implementation schedule can include both
  tasks needed for project implementation and tasks to be completed during the
  service period of the project is the weekend included in the 48 hr 72 hr
  advised timeframe for submitting the application prior to the cutoff time of 3
  1 22 2pm cst yes applicants are encouraged to complete applications with
  enough time to address any technical issues that may arise upon application
  submission keep in mind that the amplifund help desk is not open on weekends
  we are part of a collaborative application that will be submitted by another
  organization our collaborative partner has the green light for everything on
  gata except for sam s number their org is having issues generating a cage
  number they already have a sam s number but never received the cage so we
  think that s why it says in progress on their gata if we submit an app and
  their sam s number is still pending per their gata will we be auto rejected or
  what happens in these cases a pending sam code will not cause an application
  to be automatically rejected icjia does not verify sam codes until later in
  the process upon grant allocation please submit the application while waiting
  for the code to be finalized can administrative costs for things such as costs
  of hr processes and office support staff be included in the r3 service
  delivery project budget we have used a rate of 5 of the overall budget before
  for administrative costs with other applications this would be in addition to
  indirect costs which our organization has set at a standard rate of 36 if you
  can calculate how much of the hr processes and office support staff can be
  directly attributed to work on the r3 program you may include that allocation
  as direct costs if you re unable to calculate that amount they can be included
  in the indirect costs however if included as indirect costs you would need to
  stick to your negotiated rate these costs cannot be added as an additional 5
  on top of the allowable indirect costs i am in the process of completing the
  r3 application and there are sections that i have completed that are not
  showing a checkmark as completed for instance i uploaded the pra and in the
  forms section it states that it is in process can you tell me if i m doing
  something wrong select mark as complete for that section even if you ve
  already done everything such as upload the documents requested on that page
  are there any restrictions in using funds as part of the budget in providing
  funds for class enrollment at a community college or other institution of
  higher education to achieve a basic or advance certificate providing
  scholarships to college students is not currently within the scope of the
  program so that would not be an allowable cost staff enrollment into
  certificate or training programs to improve their ability to provide services
  would be allowable what is the main difference between a subaward versus
  subcontractor the main difference between a subcontractor and subawardee is
  that the subcontractor provides services to the grantee organization to help
  it run the program such as training grantee staff accounting services legal
  services office equipment and postal leases while a subawardee provides
  services to the public as part of the grantee s program and deliverables that
  fit into the grant s overall goals and objectives how can we switch our
  application from planning capacity building to service delivery amplifund does
  not allow transfers of information between application types a new application
  for service delivery application is required you can use the same login
  information to access the amplifund system to start the application however if
  we were to elect to use the de minimis indirect cost rate of 10 for the r3
  program what would the documentation requirements be on our invoices if we
  were to receive the grant yes grantees will be required to maintain
  documentation showing funds were spent on allowable overhead administrative
  costs in order to voucher for the costs grantees will not need to show direct
  calculations that allocate those costs to their grant but they will need to at
  least show evidence of having made those administrative expenditures when
  using statistical data do we have to reference where the data came from yes
  data sources are requested however a full citation is not necessary i am
  waiting for my sam gov to be verified as well as for my cage number can i
  still apply for the r3 funding opportunity yes you may still apply these items
  are not verified until the very end of the process so there is time during
  application review to complete those steps i am unaware of who owns the more
  durable office supplies that we purchase such as computers and the like so i
  guess that is one question who owns the supplies the company or the state of
  illinois if it is the state of illinois at the end of the grant cycle do we
  turn over supplies or equipment to the state and when turning over supplies
  does the data contained in a hard drive for example belong to the state for
  these grant funds there is a distinction made between equipment and supplies
  any item over 5 000 per unit is considered equipment and would need to be
  inventoried as required by the grant if the grant is terminated before the
  equipment depreciates in value to less than 5 000 and the equipment is no
  longer used for the purposes of the grant the state may retrieve it items that
  cost less than 5 000 most computers and pretty much all regular consumable
  office supplies fall into this category are considered supplies supplies are
  owned fully by the grantee and cannot be recovered by the state without
  evidence of fraud waste or mismanagement we have a duns but our sam is expired
  information lapsed during previous organizational leadership therefore we are
  not sure if we will be able to get all of the federal requirements in line
  before the due date for r3 is there anything that we can do to be able to
  still apply if we are waiting on updating our sam information yes you can
  still apply the status of the duns sam id is not verified until the last stage
  of the review so it does not need to be completed in time for the application
  due date please use the id even if it s expired to complete the information
  and continue to work with sam gov to get it up to date but in the meantime you
  are welcome to continue with the application submission i am trying to
  complete the programmatic risk assessment pra can you tell me where i can
  access an agreement number requested in the certification section you can
  leave the agreement number question of the pra blank the form is used for both
  nofos and for established grants only established grants need to enter an
  agreement number am i able to give my accountant access to the grant portal so
  she can complete the budgetary requirements of the application can she get her
  own account and access the application or can i give her my user name and
  password only the account that created the application can access that
  application in the system we recommend either working on the application along
  with your accountant using your login information or having the accountant
  contribute their portion outside of the system in a spreadsheet or word
  processing document for example and then you as the user simply entering that
  information for security reasons we do not recommend sharing your user name
  and password with another person since that means they would have full access
  to the application and may be able to enter information that you do not
  directly have control over into that application we are looking to expand
  services as well as increase capacity for a greater caseload with these r3
  funds in our application our program managers as well as our program director
  provide direct supervisory support as well as program service delivery to our
  clients and families would each of these supervisors be eligible to fund under
  r3 are they eligible at 100 for example our program managers will be taking on
  new roles and leadership responsibilities should we receive r3 in addition to
  their current roles which are 100 direct service allowable are they able to
  fund at 100 our program directly is more like 75 allowable in her role as she
  engages with all of our programming supervises all program staff and provides
  direct services herself with students and families though 25 of her time is at
  the leadership level including strategic planning and staff development etc is
  this program director eligible at 75 we have instituted no caps on the
  allowability of direct program staff other than the requirement that no staff
  exceed 100 your estimation of the percentage of their time spent on the r3
  program is the preferred way to allocate their time and effort in the budget
  the same guidance applies to all staff from supervisory program directors to
  frontline program staff as such if these percentages represent the actual time
  and effort they would be spending on the program they would be allowable in
  your budget i am the director of development and community engagement for my
  organization i will be responsible for this grant management in reading this
  above how do we determine the amount to fund within my role salary as the
  grant manager is it 10 indirect cost based on my salary or something else for
  positions such as these you should determine if it is possible to allocate the
  percentage of your time and effort to the r3 grant program itself if so please
  do so as described above if it s not your costs would be captured in the
  indirect cost category instead for this you do not need to directly allocate
  the percentage of your time but you would be able to capture only up to your
  allowable indirect cost rate the calculation of the indirect cost rate is
  explained in a bit more detail in the recording of the budget webinar located
  on the resources page at https r3 illinois gov resources https r3 illinois gov
  resources the decision is not something i can tell you for certain but comes
  down to whether your role can be allocated between programs my organization
  has an ongoing youth development program none of our current program staff
  providing these services are funded directly and we receive no state or
  federal funds we are doing our best with general operating costs i would like
  to know a can we apply for funds to support existing program staff who are not
  funded directly by anything and b may we apply for funds to provide salary
  increases to any or all of our program direct service staff to be competitive
  and support a living wage in line with the current economy you may apply for
  funds to support existing program staff or bring on new staff the salaries
  paid must be in line with your organization s policies you are not able to
  simply give increases to staff outside of your organization s personnel
  policies just because of the existence of grant funds but you may offer
  increases as allowed in your policies to existing staff such as for increased
  duties and responsibilities extended hours etc we are paying a monthly rent
  for our current facility and space which is 100 in use for program and service
  delivery this is not funded directly by any funding sources we are pulling
  from general operating to cover these costs will the full cost of rent be
  allowable given that the full space is for program use and service delivery
  and if not how do we determine and provide evidence of the prorated amount if
  the facility will be used entirely for the r3 program proposed in the
  application then the full rental costs for the building would be an allowable
  cost for this application if it is used for other programs and services apart
  from r3 you would need to prorate it using a standard allocation method i e
  allocate the cost by number of program participants square footage used by the
  different programs fte of program staff etc evidence of the reasonableness of
  the allocation methods will be evaluated during the grant agreement
  development phase if your program is funded can you submit one application
  that has two different program priorities for example a program that has
  components of both youth development and workforce development yes all
  applications must describe programs that address at least one of the five r3
  program priorities but can address more than one i will be submitting one or
  more service applications our service is a technology based fully remote
  training solution accessible by phone and internet service it requires many
  individual positions to provide the service without limit coders database
  managers videographers video editors graphic design and the like all of these
  positions work to provide the service i watched the budgeting video and the
  list of possible indirect costs included roles such as these while such would
  be ancillary to most services in our case the service can not be provided
  without these positions we intended to have them on staff and not be sub
  contracts can these be considered direct costs yes if the time and effort of
  these individuals can be directly attributed to the r3 program they are
  eligible to be included as direct costs they should be budgeted in the
  personnel section based on the percentage of time they spend on the program
  itself in that case i have my il gov account amplifund portal access duns
  number sam etc but just learned that grantees need a grants gov account to
  qualify what is that and how do i get it a grants gov account is not a
  requirement to submit the application a grants illinois gov account is
  required for amplifund access but if you ve already received your access then
  it s likely you ve already reached that step as long as you re able to access
  amplifund and submit the application you have the necessary access if you re
  not yet able to fully gain access you ll need to go to https grants illinois
  gov portal https grants illinois gov portal and select the create account
  button my organization is applying for the service delivery grant for the r3
  applications and we are working on a collaborative application with different
  community organizations in and around our service area my question is do all
  organizations or groups on our application need to be gata certified if the
  leading agency us is already certified no only the partner submitting the
  application in the amplifund system needs to be fully gata qualified however
  any collaborative partners who will be receiving grant funds through the
  program need to be minimally qualified to receive state funds in other words
  they will each need to have a duns number maintain an active sam gov account
  be in good standing with the illinois secretary of state and not be on the
  state stop payment list we plan to be a subcontractor for another organization
  are they able to apply for the grant and list us as sub contractors it is
  allowable for you to be a subawardee collaborative partner on a different
  application submitted by another organization they may apply and list you as a
  subcontractor or subaward depending on the services provided i have much of my
  own equipment needed to complete the proposed program however new equipment
  supplies will be needed should i include my supplies as in kind or leave that
  out no in kind supplies are required and neither in kind donations or matching
  funds should be included in your budget the budget should give a good picture
  of the actual operating costs of the program and should ensure that it
  contains the amount needed to operate the program if i operate a home based
  business and i do not wish to seek rent payment from the grant is that allowed
  am i required to rent office space when my program does not require in person
  meetings you are not required to include rental costs in a budget if those
  costs are not part of your program you are also not required to maintain
  office space if that is not a necessary part of your program if an employee is
  being paid a full salary and has to take up another vacant position in the
  company can they be paid for multiple jobs other than the individual s
  physical capacity to do the work are there any limitations to the number of
  positions jobs a single individual may hold a single individual cannot be
  budgeted higher than 100 of a full time equivalent position across any state
  funded programs either multiple r3 programs if funded or other state funded
  programs if applicable my organization is applying in multiple areas with the
  same program and staff if say a director is budgeted for 100 000 yr on a
  single application is that person to receive 300 000 00 if 3 applications are
  awarded if not how do we account across 3 proposed budgets for compensating
  that individual for triple the workload conversely if we were to put in 3
  applications and state that the director was paid 100 000 but 33 for each of
  the applications and only one application was approved is that director now
  only to receive 33 333 yr in other words how do we compensate for increased
  work when there are multiple grant awards how do we formulate that into the
  many proposed budgets this is a great question but unfortunately much of it
  would need to be decided by your organization as you are discussing your
  program within the application what i can say is that each application you
  submit should identify a fully formed and feasible program you should not for
  example submit a budget with a key staff member at only 33 if you are aware
  that this role will require 100 it s important that your budget accurately
  identify the costs of the program because if your program is funded it will be
  funded at the amount requested which aligns with your budgeted amount keep in
  mind that if multiple applications in different regions are submitted they may
  not all be selected for funding if they are it would be your organization s
  decision to accept and find a way to fill those roles or to decline any awards
  you are not able to carry out within the budget of the award are student
  stipends allowed as part of the budget these would be cash incentives to
  students as part of the program s apprenticeship component for timely
  completion of projects engagement in sessions and group or individual
  presentations or performance yes such stipends can be allowable if they are
  necessary and reasonable for the proposed program your budget narrative and
  program design should identify the reason for the stipends the stipends should
  be tied to specific outcomes our reentry program includes activities
  establishing community gathering spaces in communities where are participants
  will be returning such as art galleries etc we have found that many potential
  spaces require a lot of work to make them hospitable how should we proceed
  with the grant application if programming is dependent on the timeline of
  space renovation you should propose a feasible timeline in your application
  programming is scheduled to begin on july 1 2022 but each program is different
  if there are preparations that need to take place before service delivery can
  begin please account for that in your implementation schedule and your program
  description are there other things we should be aware of as we write this
  application since we have not yet rented and renovated the space but will soon
  just be aware that while renovation is an allowable cost if it is reasonable
  and necessary for the program such renovation is not allowable if it
  dramatically changes the value or the exterior configuration of a building
  besides quotes and plans what are other requirements in this application for a
  build out project e g permit requirements contractor licensing etc this
  application does not require such documentation but depending on the level and
  type of renovation they may be required when activities begin you would be
  responsible for meeting any state county or local requirements for such
  renovation such as licenses permits etc note that fees or costs for such
  permits and licenses could potentially be an allowable cost does serving the
  r3 population inside prison qualify as serving the r3 population yes how much
  of the funding can be set aside for general operations costs that will make
  this specific programming possible i believe you re referring to indirect
  costs overhead administrative costs that are not directly attributable to the
  program if so that can vary if your organization has a negotiated indirect
  cost rate agreement that agreement will identify your allowable indirect cost
  rate and base if not you may claim the de minimis rate of 10 of the mtdc base
  which includes most direct costs but excludes some costs such as rent and
  equipment for more information on indirect costs please view the budget
  webinar located under the heading of nofo informational webinars on the r3
  resources website at https r3 illinois gov resources https r3 illinois gov
  resources the fy23 icq is not yet available in the gata portal is there
  someone we should reach out to to ensure we are able to get it submitted in
  time please just make certain that the most recent icq available is completed
  and ensure that you complete the fy23 icq when it is available you won t be
  disqualified by the lack of an icq that is not available at the time of
  application is it possible to preview the program questions without going into
  amplifund can they be found on the r3 website yes the questions included in
  the application can be accessed without needing to log into amplifund by
  clicking on the apply now button for the nofo you re interested in on the main
  page of the r3 website at https r3 illinois gov https r3 illinois gov that
  button will take you to an amplifund landing page that contains some green
  buttons at the top right to apply you d click the apply button but if you only
  wish to see the questions you can click download instead this button will
  download a pdf that contains the questions you ll be asked please note that
  this removes some of the functionality written into the system especially on
  the basic information form so it won t look exactly the same but it will allow
  you to view the program questions and equity questions that you will be asked
  i inadvertently marked the budget tab complete how can i undo that action or
  do i need to start a new application you do not need to start another
  application you can just reverse the completion of the existing budget on the
  budget section of the application you should go down to the button that has
  been selected that says mark as complete if you click that mark as complete
  button again it will change to mark as in progress which should allow you to
  return it to an in progress work and allow you to continue editing the budget
  then just mark it as complete again when you finish if you apply as a single
  organization not as a collaborative do you lose the 5 points associated with
  the following question how many of the organizations in your collaborative are
  located in r3 zones 5 points no if you apply as a single organization these
  five points are instead based on your employees collaborative applicants only
  have the collaborative question and single organizations only get the employee
  question how do the additional 5 points get assigned if you are applying as a
  collaborative and some but not all of the collaborative partners are
  headquartered in an r3 zone for example if 75 of collaborating agencies are in
  an r3 zone will they get all 5 points what about 25 or 50 if at least 50 of
  the collaborative partners are located in an r3 zone the full 5 points are
  applied to the application if fewer than 50 are then no points are given for
  this question is there any conflict for recipients of a community based
  violence intervention and prevention cbvip grant or are those organizations
  eligible to apply for a grant from the restore reinvest and renew r3 program
  no there is no conflict or eligibility restriction cbvip recipients are
  eligible to apply for r3 funds the only caveat is that you should not supplant
  those funds in other words if you are granted the r3 funds you should use them
  to either expand or enhance your current program or to provide additional
  programs or services we want to apply for the icjia r3 service delivery
  opportunity in the portal the question on years of service provision says
  community involvement select the option below that best describes the amount
  of time your organization has been involved with providing community services
  northeast central region 2 we wanted to understand if the question is asking
  for years of experience in the specific r3 zone we are applying under or more
  generally how long we have provided services as an organization this question
  is asking in general how long your organization has been operating not just
  within the r3 zone the staffing section of the application has a table that
  seems like the same thing as the performance plan is it duplicative or do we
  need to complete it the implementation schedule may have some overlap with the
  performance plan but it is necessary for the staffing section the table should
  be filled out to show different steps your staff will need to take to carry
  out the program and ensure you have a plan to carry it out some items in the
  performance plan template may mirror this particularly the milestone metrics
  since they are based on reaching a goal by a set date however others may not
  this table can include process steps that are not included in the performance
  plan hiring staff reporting etc our organization has paid off its building but
  still pays utilities and taxes on the building where we would provide the
  proposed services in our r3 application assuming we request a percentage of
  these costs based on the percentage of the building the proposed r3 program
  would use are utilities and property taxes considered allowable costs
  utilities and property taxes can both be allowable costs for this program
  building owners may also claim depreciation costs these costs can be included
  as direct costs if there is a way to directly allocate all or a defined
  portion to the program or as indirect costs if such clear allocation is not
  possible the template in the grant application p 34 is different than the link
  shared during the webinar which should we use on the link budget version there
  s no place for items such as client supports and furniture where should we
  place these items the excel template is just for preparation purposes and does
  not line up exactly with the system you can include those costs on any direct
  costs page as you prepare the budget and then enter them correctly into the
  system the budget within the amplifund system allows you to enter a range of
  different types of costs just choose which category is most closely related
  and make sure you use the narrative field to explain it we are applying for a
  r3 reentry planning grant and will be using a university former reentrants and
  community providers to help develop the process the nofo talks about mous and
  linkage agreements can you please describe the difference also there are about
  25 community partners who will be participating to provide input the nofo
  indicates we need a separate linkage agreement with each one if they are not
  receiving funding can we just use an electronic signature page for the large
  group and have another with the university same question for reentrants do
  they all need to sign separate mous linkage agreements linkage agreements
  between organizations confirm their commitment to the proposed project however
  only organizations that will be funded under the proposed program are required
  to sign them no linkage agreement would be necessary from an organization that
  will provide input without funding support or from unfunded participants of
  the proposed program in a single application can we apply for multiple
  programs that would be operated by one organization for example we provide
  youth programming and prison re entry services that don t overlap in a single
  program or department can we submit one application for funding for both
  programs or if not can one organization apply for multiple programs in
  separate applications or something else yes you may submit a single
  application proposing to offer both youth programming and prison re entry
  within the same region would a business that trains in financial literacy and
  compliments job training workforces be eligible for r3 yes businesses are
  eligible to receive r3 funds as long as the funds are used to carry out social
  service programs for r3 residents and communities financial literacy and job
  training are eligible for funding under the economic development program
  priority may we include grant funds in our budget to provide stipends as
  incentives for attending group interventions to pay client wages 20 hours a
  week for the workforce development component of our program r3 funds may be
  used for stipends to encourage attendance and should be listed in your budget
  documents wage subsidies may be allowable if they are connected with specific
  program activities such as skills training this ensures participants are
  receiving meaningful benefits and are not simply being hired temporarily with
  subsidized wages wage subsidies also will need to be time limited for the same
  reason and should end with the conclusion of the training or other program
  event the needs for stipends or wage subsidies should be clearly explained in
  the context of the program goals the r3 planning nofo states that grantees
  should develop a committee to provide input on the process are applicants
  required to specify potential organizations and or provide mou or something
  similar to confirm that we will have a relationship with the member our
  inclination is to list potential member pools i e churches youth groups and
  determine specific partnerships after funding has been secured planning grant
  applicants do not need to identify committee members in the application
  linkage agreements are only required for collaborative applications where
  would we include citations for text box entries i typically use uchicago
  footnotes should i attach a bibliography citations are not required for your
  responses but if you do cite sources you can either include them within the
  text boxes at the end of your answer or attach a separate bibliography the
  bibliography or cited sources will not be evaluated only substantive responses
  to the questions will be reviewed and scored is this just a one year grant or
  can multiple years of funding be applied for we are trying to determine if the
  grant objectives should be for one year or three years grant designations will
  support 12 months of funding enter grant objectives for one year future
  designations of up to an additional 24 months of funding support may become
  available with a funding extension grantees will have an opportunity to update
  their objectives to align with the extended period of performance in reviewing
  appendix c in the grant application portal i m not seeing where a document can
  be uploaded do the evaluation pieces get incorporated into the goals
  objectives and performance measurements or are these developed only if grant
  funds are awarded there is just a check off box that states an applicant has
  reviewed the content in the application those documents are added in the
  performance plan step of the application phase appendix c is a resource for
  applicants as they develop objectives and measures and does not need to be
  completed simply check the box and then complete the performance plan if our
  r3 service proposal wants to hire a contractor for a specific allowable
  purpose does the contractor need to meet any specific requirement such as duns
  sam etc individual contractors do not need to meet those requirements vendors
  that are corporations or other business entities will require a duns number
  sam gov registration and good standing with the illinois secretary of state if
  we are applying to serve 14 r3 zones in the collar region with a max ask per
  zone of 490 820 is the max ask listed for one zone the same cap for a service
  area that covers 14 zones or is it compounded to a max ask of 23 5m the max
  caps listed are maximum amounts per region not per zone applicants may request
  a maximum up to the total per region in each application in your example that
  means on your application to serve 14 zones within the collar region you can
  request up to 490 820 for the entire region and serve all 14 zones with that
  amount the programmatic risk assessment is needed for every applicant please
  elaborate on how it effects a new organization less than 2yrs vs established
  organization more than 2yrs it is my understanding that this form carries
  weight so will points be deducted from a new company that may not have all
  protocols in place at the time of applying for r3 the pra is a required part
  of the application but is not a scored part of the application no points will
  be deducted based on your answers to the pra the pra is used internally to
  ensure that proper risk mitigation and support for grantees is in place when
  executing grant agreements can a charter school be eligible to apply yes if it
  meets the other eligibility criteria can we apply as a for profit with mous
  partners or would it be better to have the non profit lead the application
  submission no preference will be given during application review in terms of
  whether a for profit or nonprofit entity is the lead applicant both are
  eligible our organization would like to apply for both capacity building
  funding and service delivery funding can the capacity building grant run
  concurrent with our current service delivery and service delivery grant
  application yes if both are selected for funding you would be able to
  concurrently operate both programs two separate applications should be
  submitted one for each nofo type and there is no guarantee that both would be
  selected for funding my organization is planning to apply for the r3 grant we
  have an active duns number are in good standing with the secretary of state
  and have a sam registration we are now working on gata certification my
  question is do we need gata certification as a precursor to submitting the
  grant application or can we submit our application before being gata certified
  a gata account not certification is needed to create an amplifund account and
  complete and submit an application however applicants are encouraged to
  complete all prequalification steps needed for certification as soon as
  possible my organization is a foundation that does not plan to carry out a
  project but instead wants to apply for funds to pass the grant money through
  to other organizations who will apply to provide services in the community we
  would ensure that our applicant organizations would provide services to r3
  communities and satisfy all of the r3 requirements but we think that our
  existing goals and networks would allow us to identify good service providers
  we also work with our grantees to provide them with opportunities for growth
  and capacity building which would be an additional benefit of our process can
  we apply for funding for this purpose yes however your organization as lead
  organization must satisfy all funding requirements and a competitive selection
  process will be required to identify the subgrantees all subgrantees must
  provide services in r3 eligible areas lead organizations must include a
  program design and performance metrics in their applications with a clear
  description of services to be provided by the subgrantees is there a recording
  that can help me complete the performance plan within the amplifund system for
  this nofo yes view the creating a performance plan for the r3 nofo recording

  illinois gov resources https r3 illinois gov resources my organization just
  received funding for violence prevention through icjia are we still eligible
  to apply to expand our program using an r3 grant if we are already an icjia
  grantee yes current r3 grantees may apply for r3 funds however current r3
  grantees may not propose to provide services in the same region if they
  already serve as lead organization in another r3 funded program in addition
  for first time lead organizations new funding must be used to expand existing
  programs or services what is the difference between the planning capacity
  building and the service delivery grant can an organization apply for both of
  them the planning and capacity building nofo offers funds in two areas
  planning funds will support organizations who want to bring together community
  stakeholders in r3 zones to identify local needs identify strengths and
  weaknesses or gaps in addressing those needs and develop a plan to provide
  services to address those gaps capacity building funds support organizations
  as they build or improve their own internal ability to manage grant funds or
  provide services this funding can be used for training recruitment staffing or
  other needs an organization may have to start or improve their service
  delivery organizations may apply for grants to support planning capacity
  building or both in a single application the service delivery nofo offers
  funding to organizations that will actively provide services in their
  communities these grants will support direct services to program participants
  who live in r3 zones funding may be used for program personnel supplies
  equipment travel and other costs that are related to a program of direct
  services to community residents yes organizations may apply for both types
  separate applications are required and will be individually evaluated for
  funding our organization wants to help clients who experience mental and
  behavioral health issues better connect with public benefits to that end we
  plan to hire mental health social work case management professionals to
  connect them to services since these would not be legal professionals would
  this still qualify under the civil legal aid program priority or will r3 only
  fund proposals for attorneys and legal staff to provide civil legal aid
  services providing assistance in accessing public benefits to which a client
  is legally entitled would be a grant eligible civil legal aid service legal
  staff or staff attorneys are not required however staff budgeted for this role
  should be prorated appropriately in the budget if they provide services that
  are not related to the program for example if you hire a mental health
  professional who provides counseling services in addition to assisting clients
  in accessing public benefits the counseling services would not fall under
  civil legal aid and should not be included in the budget for that program in
  the application under applicant information applicant s organization unit it
  asks for department name can you please further explain what information you
  are looking for here some application questions are not applicable to all
  organizations if the question is not applicable to your organization feel free
  to leave it blank we are applying to serve clients from three high need r3
  zones but our general service area is larger than that the funding we would
  request would then be tied to the number of the children we serve specifically
  from those three areas right if so can you provide me with the zip codes for
  those areas the funding for this program is not necessarily awarded on a per
  client basis instead budget and program descriptions should list costs
  necessary to carry out the entire program consider your estimated number of
  clients in r3 zones to be served by your proposed program as you create your
  budget go to https r3 illinois gov eligibility https r3 illinois gov
  eligibility and use the map to find the r3 zones you propose to serve as a
  starting point for determining zip codes in your service area as a way for an
  organization to increase its capacity for launching a large scale service
  delivery program in the near future e g re entry program is it possible to
  utilize the capacity building portion of the r3 grant to staff pilot and
  evaluate a smaller scale service delivery program yes carrying out a pilot
  project and subsequent evaluation to determine if the project should be
  carried out on a larger scale is within the scope of the planning capacity
  building nofo are subgrantees allowed to be a part of an r3 application
  submitted by a single agency in other words if my organization applied as a
  single agency would we be able to engage additional organization partners as
  subgrantees through an rfp selection process yes that would be allowable your
  organization will be required to conduct a competitive selection process to
  identify those subgrantees what is the economic development money used for
  economic development grants may be used to support programming such as
  personnel and fringe supplies equipment travel contractual indirect and other
  costs necessary and reasonable to provide an economic development program
  economic development programs may include job readiness and workforce
  development trainings improvement of community shared spaces training and
  support for local entrepreneurs and other services could the funds be used to
  operate a community space where startups rent office space this is potentially
  allowable applicants must describe how grant funds will be used to provide
  services or benefits to the community above and beyond the rental costs that
  would be paid for the space can the r3 funds be used for both capital and
  operational costs funds can be used for operational costs to run a program and
  some equipment costs that are reasonable and necessary for the program r3
  funds may not be used to support capital expenditures for the purchase of real
  property such as buildings or land or the construction or significant
  renovation of property do you have to have gata please explain what gata is
  applicants must create an account in the gata grant management portal at https
  grants illinois gov portal https grants illinois gov portal before accessing
  completing and submitting an application collaborative partners on a
  collaborative application do not need this account can r3 be used to acquire
  space r3 funds may be used to rent space but not to purchase property such as
  a building or land who are the decision makers and can we receive a full list
  of committee r3 board members are listed here https r3 illinois gov board
  https r3 illinois gov board when will an organization be awarded the grant
  icjia anticipates making grant award announcements in may with the grant
  period to begin july 1 2022 what does it mean to be minimally eligible for
  state funds to become minimally eligible applicant organizations must have a
  sam gov account and a duns number and be in good standing with the illinois
  secretary of state in addition they must not appear on the state of illinois
  stop payment list how labor intensive is the application the application has
  been streamlined to help ease the process for potential grantees that said a
  number of questions must be answered to assist application reviewers as they
  evaluate the grant proposals get started on the application as soon as
  possible to ensure plenty of time is available to complete and submit it
  before the deadline of march 1 2022 at 2 p m what if i don t have my 501c3
  status 501 c 3 status is not a requirement for application please let me know
  where i can find the link to access the program requirements for the r3
  service grant nofo is it possible to find out the program requirements without
  going into the actual submission porta yes go to the r3 nofo instructions and
  appendices section at https r3 illinois gov resources https r3 illinois gov
  resources will r3 cover public transit and or private rideshare eg uber lyft
  fares for client transportation for appointments court dates social services
  screenings to clarify we also wanted to include rideshares since some clients
  might not live near public transportation yes transportation costs are
  allowable if the need for the cost is justified within the program s design
  and budget while our main office is not located in an r3 zone we will be
  collaborating with a subrecipient within an r3 zone to provide housing and
  support services for the questions related to equity do we include
  demographics and information about our collaborator subrecipient yes please
  provide demographics and related information on all collaborative partners
  when answering the equity questions when answering local preference questions
  in the program questions section please only provide this information as it
  relates to the primary applicant is there a required minimum number of goals
  and objectives that should be listed for grant proposed activities under the
  service delivery grant no however listing objectives and performance measures
  for each of your proposed activities will help application reviewers evaluate
  the strength of those objectives within in the proposed program are costs to
  hire and engage an outside evaluator an eligible cost costs to hire an outside
  evaluator may be eligible if an evaluation is reasonable and necessary to
  carry out your program outside evaluators may be more applicable to a planning
  and capacity building grant than to a service delivery grant but in either
  case the reason for the evaluator should be justified in the context of the
  program design also icjia s r3 research team is carrying out its own external
  overall r3 program evaluation applicants should describe the specific purposes
  of their proposed program evaluation for funding consideration is an outside
  evaluation required for this grant no however grantees may be asked to
  participate in the r3 research team s statewide evaluation of the program
  funded by icjia under additional performance metrics appendix c required by
  the grantor listed for specific categories under violence prevention it has if
  applicable to your program could you please explain applicable to your program
  is this defined by us up front or is this defined by icjia after review of the
  application based on our program design etc if applicable to your program is a
  prompt for you to choose only metrics that apply to the program you are
  proposing some metrics listed may not relate to your program design the
  applicable metrics are selected defined by you up front and should be related
  to the design of your proposed program and yes these metrics could change with
  grant approval and in discussion with icjia staff in the submission of a
  collaborative program is an mou required for all members of the collaborative
  even if they are not going to receive direct funds from this grant application
  all collaborative members included in the proposed program as budgeted
  subgrantees must submit a mou is it within the scope of the nofo to provide
  funds for general home repairs for needy families even though these families
  aren t involved with the criminal justice system yes such services may be
  provided to all residents of r3 zones with service delivery grant funding as
  long as the proposed program serves as least one of the r3 program priorities
  civil legal aid economic development reentry violence prevention and youth
  development if an organization is a subrecipient of the previous r3 funding
  awards can they be a lead organization in a collaborative pursuing funding or
  even apply for funding this round yes we have a teen program for youth ages 14
  18 and serve teens from 25 different chicago high schools as i reviewed the
  map for areas approved to receive the r3 funding i wasn t sure if our
  community was included but because we serve teens from various communities i
  wanted to know if we are be eligible to apply for this grant yes any
  organization may apply as long as their proposed program s service areas and
  or residents are r3 eligible use the r3 eligibility map at https r3 illinois
  gov eligibility https r3 illinois gov eligibility to locate where your
  participants reside or where services will be provided to determine grant
  eligibility i am planning to apply as the responsible applicant organization
  for a collaborative one of the organizations in the collaborative is
  headquartered in indiana is this permissible or must they be located in
  illinois yes out of state providers may deliver services to communities in r3
  zones are we still eligible to apply even though we would be only asking for
  funding for a small portion of our region that we serve our service area
  covers an entire county however there is only one city in that county that is
  an r3 zone the city makes up most of our clients but are we still eligible
  even though we cover other areas that aren t r3 zones yes however the proposed
  program should serve only the r3 eligible area is there a limit or any
  additional restrictions around how renovations may be included in our
  application budget we are considering modifications to our waiting area to
  accommodate additional mental health and substance abuse services and take
  steps to ensure safety of employees and program participants renovations are
  allowable costs if they improve the capacity of an existing space to offer the
  proposed program renovations are not allowable if they will dramatically alter
  the function or value of an existing space the purchase or construction of
  real property also is not an allowable cost if our re entry program works with
  currently incarcerated prisoners nearing release to advocate for better
  discharge plans do we calculate r3 eligibility using the prison s address many
  re entry programs use the permanent residence of the program participant when
  it is available however for programs that work with individuals who are
  incarcerated that may be challenging in that case it is acceptable to use the
  prison address be sure to note it in the program design portion of the
  application the peoria park district is considering applying to operate a
  program at one of our facilities that would primarily serve residents within
  r3 zones however the best facility for this program is located just outside of
  an r3 zone but surrounded by them i ve included a photo below to demonstrate
  the situation the areas shaded in orange are r3 zones as designated by the
  state of illinois the black outline is the boundary of the peoria park
  district which includes nearly all of the r3 zones in peoria the green dot is
  where we have a facility that we d like to consider operating programming with
  r3 funding this program would draw participants primary from r3 zones without
  being located in an r3 zone itself the nearest r3 zone is located 0 5 miles
  away from the facility i am wondering whether 1 our application would be
  considered if we made the case that this facility served mostly residents of
  r3 zones or 2 our application would be scored very negatively because the
  facility in question is not located in an r3 zone if you think it is unlikely
  we might receive funding for a program in a facility outside of an r3 zone we
  would consider alternative options that may be less efficient but located in
  an r3 zone applications may receive fewer local preference points if the
  applicant organization is not headquartered in an r3 zone however any
  organization may apply as long as their proposed program s service areas and
  or residents are r3 eligible use the r3 eligibility map at https r3 illinois
  gov eligibility https r3 illinois gov eligibility to locate where your
  participants reside or where services will be provided to determine grant
  eligibility i have a question about allowable expenses on the r3 service
  delivery nofo will participant stipends incentives be allowable on this grant
  budget for example we have a workforce development program where we provide
  stipends for participant attendance would that be an allowable program expense
  yes stipends and incentives for participants are allowable if they are
  reasonable and necessary for your program design if selected for funding
  additional documentation may be required to ensure stipends and incentives are
  appropriately monitored if our ask is 145k can icjia come back and offer a
  different amount applicants may receive awards that are less than what they
  requested in that event applicants must determine whether they can make budget
  and other adjustments to their proposed programs before accepting their award
  is the amount for salary hourly for the entire grant period so if i am
  calculating an hourly wage i would put the number of hours equal to the grant
  period correct yes that s correct include total salary costs for the entire
  program period in the proposed budget can the lead agency be a school or
  school district yes are there character word or page limits to the questions
  or to the application overall no can photos and graphics be added to the
  application the amplifund system allows for photo and graphic uploads however
  documents photos and graphics that are not specifically requested by or
  required of the nofo will not be scored for our proposed program facility
  improvements and the securing of a teaching facility will be necessary does r3
  funding allow for facility developments renovations can be allowable costs if
  they improve the capacity of an existing space to offer the proposed program
  renovations are not allowable if they dramatically alter the function or value
  of an existing space the purchase or construction of real property is not an
  allowable cost does r3 funding allow for the purchase of teaching materials
  and equipment yes if these costs are reasonable and necessary for the proposed
  program does r3 funding allow for transportation and temporary lodging to
  participate in a training program for staff and participants yes if these
  costs are reasonable and necessary for the proposed program we are looking to
  expand our program and we are planning to do so in three phases the proposal
  we want to submit for r3 is for the first phase of the expansion does r3
  funding allow for funding an initial phase when future phases and funding will
  be required r3 planning and capacity building nofo grants will support program
  development and expansion the service delivery nofo allows for an initial
  phase of program expansion assuming services are offered as part of that
  expansion we are having trouble translating the instructions for creating
  performance measures given in the appendices to the form in amplifund will
  there be more information or some examples that can help with this yes web
  training on creating a performance plan for the r3 nofo was held thursday
  january 27 2022 at 10 00 a m you can view the recording of the training at the
  following link https youtu be yh9 qrlmi4q https youtu be yh9 qrlmi4q this
  webinar recording and associated slide deck are also available here https r3
  illinois gov resources https r3 illinois gov resources our organization is not
  located in an r3 zone but a large portion of the clients we service do reside
  within r3 zones since not all of the clients we service reside in r3 zones
  should we prorate our funding by the proportion of r3 clients to non r3
  clients the guidelines of the r3 program do not require that grantees provide
  address checks for clients to ensure they are residents of r3 zones it is
  sufficient for programs to provide services centered around the eligible r3
  zones that said if you have the ability to distinguish your clients based on
  residence and can prorate costs in that manner you may use that information to
  demonstrate a benefit of your proposed program in the application cost
  effectiveness local focus etc will a budget template be provided to help us
  create the budget that we will then enter into amplifund for our application a
  sample excel budget template can be accessed here https r3 illinois gov
  resources https r3 illinois gov resources the template may be used to develop
  a working budget the information entered in the working budget must then be
  placed into amplifund which section of the budget should i use to input
  payroll taxes and insurance payroll taxes and insurance costs are most
  commonly entered separately into the budget s fringe benefits section some
  organizations payroll services offer reports that do not list a salary
  breakdown that includes payroll taxes and insurance if you are not able to
  separate the payroll taxes and insurance from an individual s salary please
  enter the total salary amount into the payroll section our population of focus
  has high mobility do we select the zones where we provide services yes what
  age range does r3 use to define youth for this grant r3 s establishing
  legislation offers no set age range requirement for the youth development
  program priority youth development proposals should reflect the general spirit
  of the r3 program which seeks to treat violence and address the social
  determinants of health or promote community investment applicants should
  identify the age range of focus for their proposed programs and explain how
  their programs will serve address those goals some organizations are operated
  out of peoples homes and do not have a business address apart from the home
  address will that be looked down upon in the r3 application or for preference
  points all addresses both residential and business will be evaluated for local
  preference the application will be scored on the strength of the proposal not
  the existence of a devoted business address or lack thereof can funding be
  used to provide direct home repair grants to low and moderate income
  households under economic development yes r3 funds may be used for general
  home repair however they may not be used to pay for construction that would
  dramatically change the structure function or value of a building regarding
  the illinois r3 service delivery grant who should letters of support and
  linkage agreements be addressed to letters of support are not required for
  this application and will not be reviewed linkage agreements should be
  established with documentation between the primary applicant of the
  collaborative and the collaborative partner would you please let us know how
  much total funding is available per funding region per tier we see the tier
  ranges but would also like to know total dollars available to help us
  determine our request amount the maximum will depend on your tier and the
  funding opportunity for which you are applying you can see the total available
  by clicking on your region of the eligibility map here https r3 illinois gov
  eligibility https r3 illinois gov eligibility the total within each grant
  region is the maximum amount that can be requested by an applicant i am
  interested in your grant but not sure if i qualify i am a small business that
  hasn t made a lot of money really very little and i m the only employee right
  now i was just wondering if i had a great idea if you would fund on the basis
  of that only or do i need to have made a significant amount of money also do i
  need more than one employee there are no rules preventing small businesses
  either in terms of revenue or in terms of employees from applying for this
  grant if you have an idea for a program that is in line with the goals and
  program priorities of the r3 program you are welcome to apply where can i
  locate the nofo instructions and appendices a b and c described in the nofo
  questions the instructions and appendices a b and c can be found within the
  application in amplifund in the nofo instructions section you can also find
  them under the nofo instructions and appendices section here https r3 illinois
  gov resources https r3 illinois gov resources can a newly established
  organization non for profit apply for this funding what about an llc yes newly
  established organizations are eligible to apply llcs are also eligible this
  funding opportunity is open to for profit businesses established nonprofits
  new nonprofits faith based organizations and local units of government can my
  organization apply to both types of grant service delivery and planning
  capacity building yes organizations may apply for both types separate
  applications are required and will be individually evaluated for funding i am
  interested in being a reviewer for the r3 applications are there any
  eligibility requirements to be a reviewer also how much of a time commitment
  is anticipated how many applications do you expect reviewers to go through i
  am trying to gauge what is involved in being a reviewer including any training
  or workshops before and after the march 1st deadline training time is
  estimated at about two hours the volume of work expected and time commitment
  may vary based on how many reviewers we have but reviewers can expect to
  review between five and eight applications with each taking approximately an
  hour of review time for more information on what is required for r3 grant
  application reviewer and to register please click here https icjia illinois
  gov news join our volunteer reviewer pool https icjia illinois gov news join
  our volunteer reviewer pool the equity questions ask for descriptions of real
  life situations of how agency leaders and front line staff have used their
  roots in the community to improve the organization s programming leadership
  and improve their works with individuals in the community front line staff
  must examples be specific to the program for which we are requesting funding
  or can they be representative of the broader programs that serve our community
  similarly must the community to be served story be specific to proposed
  program and neighborhoods in the r3 zone only i ask the question because our
  organization serves a community including but larger than those in the r3
  zones ie those that would be the target audience for the proposed program
  these questions can be answered in terms of your organization s and
  collaborative partners overall service provision it is understood that
  organizations may be serving areas broader than their specific r3 zones you
  may include examples of experience garnered within those broader areas as long
  as they clearly relate to or encompass the program types and eligible areas
  discussed in the nofo for the awarding of local preference points the
  application asks for our headquarters or main office location we are a
  statewide organization with regional administrative headquarters throughout
  the state and a statewide administrative headquarters in chicago if we are
  applying for a grant to provide services in east st louis and our regional
  main office is located in an r3 zone but our statewide main office is not
  should we include our regional headquarters office location the regional main
  office is where all local work is managed and decisions are made our statewide
  office houses statewide infrastructure such as hr it and development there is
  much variety in how different organizations structure their local regional and
  primary offices for uniformity the local preference criteria is based on the
  location of the organization s main headquarters as such please use your
  organization s headquarters not regional main office for the local preference
  entry if we apply as part of a collaboration does the budget and longevity of
  the lead applicant determine which tier our application falls in or is it
  based on each member of the collaborative only the lead organization s
  information is used to determine the tier in a collaborative application can a
  new illinois non profit organization that is not currently a formal 501c3 irs
  tax exempt entity apply for these funds if so must that step be in process at
  the time of our grant proposal submission by march 1st 501 c 3 status is not
  required to apply for these funds how are r3 funds disbursed it is
  reimbursement is there an opportunity for an initial disbursement of funds to
  begin programming if it is only reimbursement how is icjia working to create
  more equitable funding structures for organizations that don t have the
  capacity needed for a reimbursement setup r3 grants are disbursed using three
  methods designed to ensure that grantees have the necessary cash flow to carry
  out their approved programs without necessarily having the capital
  independently of their r3 grant award they include advance payment grantees
  may elect to receive payment in advance monthly based on their ongoing
  expenditure projections for the quarter icjia will evaluate requests for
  advanced payment to ensure that grantees meet certain administrative
  requirements working capital advances grantees who are not eligible for
  advance payment plan may request a working capital advance that amounts to the
  projection of the first two months expenses including startup costs following
  disbursal of the working capital advance grantees will be paid via
  reimbursement of actual expenditures reconciliation occurs toward the end of
  the grant period to ensure that the grantee completes final closeout of the
  grant with a 0 grant balance reimbursement grantees who do not require advance
  payment or a working capital advance are paid via reimbursement of actual
  expenditures my organization is eligible to submit under several funding
  regions and i see in the nofo that it is acceptable to submit one application
  per eligible funding region can you please describe the review process across
  the various funding regions for example if we submit 2 separate applications
  for 2 different funding regions would our applications each be reviewed by
  different individuals or are all applications from an organization reviewed by
  the same individual group applications for each region are reviewed separately
  by different teams of reviewers be aware that since funding competition occurs
  within not between regions it is possible that an organization s application
  in one region will be awarded funding while its other is not this possibility
  may have implications for proposed program designs intended to cross regional
  boundaries on the basic information page do we have to select the r3 zones for
  all of the neighborhoods where our participants come from that ll be quite a
  few yes please list all r3 zones in your service area where can i view the

  are current r3 grantees eligible to apply for another grant current r3
  grantees are only eligible to apply either for new grant funding for programs
  proposed in a different region or under a different nofo type to serve their
  current region for example current service delivery grantee mays only apply
  for a capacity building grant within the same region current grantees may
  apply as part of a collaborative but cannot apply directly as lead applicant
  if they already hold direct funding within the proposed region is there an
  organization budget limit on this nofo there is no restriction preventing
  agencies from applying based on the size of their budgets but annual agency
  budget size is considered when grouping applicants into the set tiers there
  also is no predetermined grant award limit the maximum amount that can be
  requested is based on a number of factors you can determine that amount by
  completing the nofo s basic information form can a current r3 grantee be a
  collaborative partner not the lead in the region covered by their original
  grant but within a different r3 zone yes a current r3 grantee can be a
  collaborative partner on another application within the same region they
  cannot serve as lead on two applications grants since we need to submit a
  requested grant amount for the application in amplifund before we get to the
  basic information form that tells us what our allowable amount range is can we
  put in a placeholder amount first and change it when we know what the actual
  amount can be yes just remember to revise that amount if it is determined the
  amount is outside of the allowable range or if the amount has changed for any
  other reason can our organization send in one application for violence
  prevention and one application for youth development in hopes securing at
  least one organizations may not submit more than one service delivery
  application per region however you may submit a single application proposing
  to offer both violence prevention and youth development services organizations
  also may serve as both a lead applicant and a non lead collaborative partner
  this requires the organization to partner another applicant to perform any of
  the service types i had a question regarding the restore reinvest and renew r3
  grants program for planning and capacity awards and service delivery awards
  both of the provided nofos initially state the following applicants may be
  included in only one application submitted per funding region in other words
  if an organization is part of a collaborative submitting an application in one
  region they may not submit a single application in the same region however the
  nofos also state the following applicants may submit only one application per
  funding region however if an organization is part of a collaborative
  submitting an application in one region they may also submit a collaborative
  application of their own or a single application in the same region just to
  confirm may applicants submit both a collaborative and single application
  within one funding region applicants may submit a single application and serve
  as a collaborative partner not the lead responsible applicant in a second
  application within the same funding region applicants may not serve as single
  or lead applicant in two applications within the same region in the
  application there is reference to the term agency does that term refer to all
  parties in the collaborative or just the lead agency when answering questions
  about the responsible applicant on the application form agency refers to the
  responsible applicant alone the organization submitting the application on
  behalf of a collaborative it does not refer to all parties of the
  collaborative when answering questions about the program such as in the
  program questions or equity questions of the application it can refer to the
  entire collaborative can this funding be used for services we re already
  providing or do we have to apply for a totally new service these grant funds
  cannot replace other funding without an increase in service provision
  organizations must demonstrate either an expansion of current services or
  addition of new services to the current program the proposed program must
  serve new or additional participants or provide enhanced or additional service
  to existing participants will businesses we contract with who may also appear
  on other applications be penalized for example if we use an online portal for
  hiring a certain population and someone else also purchases access to the same
  portal will that disqualify both applicants no there is no restriction
  limiting vendors from working for more than one grantee or applicant can a
  community receive funding for two planning grants provided they are different
  topics yes if the two applications score highly enough to be funded there
  could be two planning grants operating in the same community for different
  purposes if were looking to hire a grant fiscal manager would that be
  allowable under the planning and capacity building grant also if i wanted to
  increase some staff s salary to move them into a supervisory role would that
  be allowable if so would that also be under the planning and capacity building
  grant or the service delivery grant hiring a grant fiscal manager and moving
  staff into a supervisory role with a salary increase is allowed both as part
  of a service delivery budget and as a capacity building grant activity the
  instructions say to list the zone id numbers for each r3 zone our program
  serves we serve all of sangamon county do we list every zone in sangamon
  county or just the zone where our office is located list every r3 zone you
  propose to serve if your service area covers the entire county list all r3
  zones in that county the table underneath the map at https r3 illinois gov
  eligibility https r3 illinois gov eligibility will help you identify all r3
  zones in your county if capital expenditures are not allowable costs how do we
  interpret investment in community infrastructure and housing some examples of
  such investment activities include providing workforce development
  opportunities in the community repairing and remodeling community spaces and
  finishing and supplying temporary housing for re entering citizens we were
  told that organizations that have annual budgets of less than 2 5 million are
  the only ones qualified to apply our budget is about 5 million annually can we
  apply for the r3 grant yes there is no restriction preventing agencies from
  applying based on the size of their budgets but annual agency budget size is
  considered when grouping applicants into tiers our organization is relatively
  new and has not been fully funded however we are working with a very
  established partner we are not yet sure who will be lead agency on the
  application how do we determine the tier and thus how much we can apply for
  your tier will be based on the annual budget of the agency submitting the
  application combined with the length of time that agency has been operating
  for example if the agency submitting the application has been operating for
  two years or more and has a budget of less than 2 million annually the
  application would be placed in the tier two category the agency you describe
  may have a higher budget and be categorized into a different tier the proposed
  service region is another variable in calculating the eligible amount to
  determine your eligible award range complete the basic information form within
  the application using the information you would use to apply are there any
  character or word count limits for the responses to the questions in program
  questions and equity questions sections there are no character or word count
  limits for the narrative questions in those application sections we want to
  provide sufficient space for applicants to fully explain their programs we
  only ask that applicants do so in a clear and concise manner we are a current
  assessment and planning grantee and the end date for our program was extended
  to june 30 since the new r3 service delivery applications are due march 1 does
  that mean we can no longer take advantage of the longer project period for the
  current grant no this nofo does not require completion of the assessment and
  planning process prior to applying for a new grant describing the planning
  process and any findings in relation to the service delivery program being
  proposed in your application would be sufficient does our program need to
  address a new scope of participants with this funding or can it be applied to
  an already established program these grant funds cannot replace other funding
  without an increase in service provision organizations must demonstrate either
  an expansion of current services or addition of new services to the current
  program the proposed program must serve new or additional participants or
  provide enhanced or additional service to existing participants is this going
  to be a one time funding source or will it be renewable these designations
  will support 12 months of funding future designations of up to an additional
  24 months of funding support may become available my organization has been in
  existence for over 20 years but has never received grant funds and never had a
  significant annual budget would the fact that it has been around so long put
  it into a tier competing with bigger organizations no organizations that have
  existed for longer than two years but have an annual budget of less than 2
  million will be placed in tier two the tier system was set up to ensure that
  longstanding community organizations with smaller budgets do not compete with
  larger organizations regardless of how long they have been operating is there
  anywhere to read on best practices and or communities that have successfully
  implemented the r3 funding visit this page for all available r3 research https
  r3 illinois gov resources https r3 illinois gov resources are there specific
  definitions that showcase what would qualify for funding with the areas of
  economic development and economic disinvestment are there breakdowns
  explaining each area of focus the definitions are open to provide the
  flexibility needed to accommodate each community s unique needs applicants are
  encouraged to propose programs that would best address the needs of their
  communities while there are no specific definitions for those areas the nofo s
  appendix a r3 program priorities provides a brief explanation and examples of
  activities for each program priority area can we apply for both the planning
  and the implementation grant if we have a program ready to be provided but
  would like to add elements and do a study to determine which elements are most
  needed in our community yes organizations may apply for both types separate
  applications are required and will be individually evaluated for funding can
  an application for an r3 capacity building grant and service grant be
  submitted in the same r3 zone yes organizations may apply for both types of
  funding for use in the same r3 zone separate applications are required and
  will be individually evaluated for funding our organization had a question
  regarding letters of intent i noticed that the previous r3 opportunity and
  many others provided by icjia have required letters of intent however i don t
  see anything in this nofo requiring it i just wanted to make sure that we
  weren t missing a deadline notices of intent were not requested for this
  funding opportunity applications are due at 2 p m on march 1 2022 is this
  service delivery grant for youth and adults as i review the application
  details i read information reporting youth service delivery i do not see
  anything stating the word adult in the service delivery i do see the word
  client in the service delivery sections program participants served by youth
  development programs should be youth but other types of programs under the
  other r3 program priorities can serve youth or adult participants depending on
  the needs of the community and the proposed program is there a charge to get
  an amplifund account or submit an application through the amplifund system no
  there is no cost to register for or submit an application through amplifund
  how should we read the word agency in the equity section does it only apply to
  the responsible applicant or to all members of the collaborative several

## R3 Grants -- Current Round of Funding

### Question and Answers Posting Schedule

Questions and answers will be posted on a weekly basis. Questions will be posted each Friday.

### Questions Submissions

Any questions regarding the current NOFOs can be emailed to [CJA.R3Questions@illinois.gov](mailto:CJA.R3Questions@illinois.gov). These questions will be answered via email from that same email account. They will also be collected and posted on this page as described above.

[Responses to Submitted Questions - Updated 2/25/2022](https://r3.icjia-api.cloud/uploads/R3_NOFO_Questionsand_Answers_6b7cd8ca02.pdf?updated_at=2022-12-15T14:23:32.390Z):

<div class="ml-10" style="background: #fafafa; padding: 10px 50px 10px 50px; border: 1px solid #f1f1f1">

### Note: The R3 application deadline is March 8, 2022, at 2:00 p.m. This reflects an extension of one week from the initial application deadline of March 1, 2022. Applicants are encouraged to complete their applications with enough time to address any technical issues that may arise upon application submission. 

Having trouble accessing your R3 application in AmpliFund? 

Please review the AmpliFund Login Tip Sheet for log in steps: [https://r3.illinois.gov/downloads/LoggingintoAmpliFundAugust21.pdf](https://r3.icjia-api.cloud/uploads/Logginginto_Ampli_Fund_August21_a071221af7.pdf?updated_at=2022-12-15T14:23:33.543Z)

This AmpliFund Walkthrough video also may be helpful: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONGy3XawjCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONGy3XawjCA)

For further assistance, please contact the AmpliFund Help Desk at (216)377-5500 ext. 2.These resources and more are available at: [https://r3.illinois.gov/resources](/resources)

### When I go to the R3 website, there’s a countdown to the application deadline. However, it seems to give me less time than there really is before the deadline of March 1. Can you confirm the application due date?

 The due date is March 1 at 2:00 p.m. CST. There are only 28 days in February, so the deadline may seem to be coming more quickly than expected. Please keep that in mind while finalizing your application for submission.

### For the Indirect Cost rate, we plan to include the 10% de minimus rate to the total application funding budget. Is that correct, or is there a different required method to assign the Indirect Cost amount at 10%?  

 That’s correct. The budget should include the Indirect Cost The amount should be included in the budget request.

### Can you advise us on the budget category to which a particular cost should be assigned?

 Use your best judgment when assigning costs to each category. Grant applications will be reviewed for content, not for inconsequential technical issues, such as where budget items are assigned.

### Within the ways that the categories are listed in AmpliFund, we are seeking clarity around the "non-grant funded" and "total budget" sections. Is the intention for the Expense Budget for us to adjust our entire spending budget / expenses for FY23 to be reflected within the state's budget categories (salary, fringe benefits, supplies, etc.)? And then the total should reflect the amount we plan to spend in each of those areas IN TOTAL, i.e. the sum of the proposed grant funds plus anticipated non-grant funded expenses? 
Similarly, for the Revenue Budget, are we to divide and include our overall organizational annual revenue projected for FY23 into the categories of the state - our entire operating budget should be reflected within this Budget?

 Please disregard NON-GRANT FUNDED and REVENUE sections. Your application should only discuss grant expenditures  to be made in the proposed program.

### Will we be asked to upload the budget worksheets in excel to our application?  If not will the Agency Approval, FFATA forms be in the application somewhere? I have not seen them in there.

 Submit only the AmpliFund budget; no other budget forms are requested or required when applying. Other forms will be required if your organization is selected for a grant.

### Are we able to ask for the full amount for our program costs or do we have to make cash and in-kind contributions as well?

 No cash or in-kind match contributions are required for this program.

### For the Implementation Schedule, does this include tasks/due dates for the implementation of the project? Or is this tasks/due dates for once the program is implemented? Or, both?

 The implementation schedule can include both tasks needed for project implementation and tasks to be completed during the service period of the project

### Is the weekend included in the 48 hr/ 72 hr advised timeframe for submitting the application prior to the cutoff time of 3/1/22 2pm CST?

 Yes. Applicants are encouraged to complete applications with enough time to address any technical issues that may arise upon application submission. Keep in mind that the AmpliFund Help Desk is not open on weekends. 

### We are part of a collaborative application that will be submitted by another organization. Our collaborative partner has the green light for everything on GATA except for SAM's number. Their org is having issues generating a CAGE number, they already have a SAM's number but never received the CAGE so we think that's why it says "in progress" on their GATA.

If we submit an app, and their SAM's number is still pending per their GATA, will we be auto rejected?? Or, what happens in these cases?

 A pending SAM code will not cause an application to be automatically rejected. ICJIA does not verify SAM codes until later in the process, upon grant allocation. Please submit the application while waiting for the code to be finalized.

### Can administrative costs for things such as costs of HR processes and office support staff be included in the R3 Service Delivery project budget? We have used a rate of 5% of the overall budget before for administrative costs with other applications. This would be in addition to indirect costs, which our organization has set at a standard rate of 36%.

 If you can calculate how much of the HR processes and office support staff can be directly attributed to work on the R3 program, you may include that allocation as direct costs. If you’re unable to calculate that amount, they can be included in the indirect costs. However, if included as indirect costs, you would need to stick to your negotiated rate; these costs cannot be added as an additional 5% on top of the allowable indirect costs.

### I am in the process of completing the R3 Application and there are sections that I have completed that are not showing a checkmark as completed.  For instance, I uploaded the PRA and in the forms section it states that it is in process.  Can you tell me if I’m doing something wrong?

 Select ‘Mark as Complete’ for that section, even if you’ve already done everything (such as upload the documents requested) on that page. 

### Are there any restrictions in using funds as part of the budget in providing funds for class enrollment at a community college or other institution of higher education to achieve a basic or advance certificate?

 Providing scholarships to college students is not currently within the scope of the program, so that would not be an allowable cost. Staff enrollment into certificate or training programs to improve their ability to provide services would be allowable.

### What is the main difference between a subaward versus subcontractor?

 The main difference between a subcontractor and subawardee is that the subcontractor provides services to the grantee organization to help it run the program (such as training grantee staff, accounting services, legal services, office equipment, and postal leases) while a subawardee provides services to the public as part of the grantee’s program and  deliverables that fit into the grant’s overall goals and objectives.

### How can we switch our application from Planning & Capacity Building to Service Delivery?

 AmpliFund does not allow transfers of information between application types. A new application for Service Delivery application is required. You can use the same login information to access the AmpliFund system to start the application, however.

### If we were to elect to use the de minimis indirect cost rate of 10% for the R3 program, what would the documentation requirements be on our invoices if we were to receive the grant?

 Yes, grantees will be required to maintain documentation showing funds were spent on allowable overhead/administrative costs in order to voucher for the costs. Grantees will not need to show direct calculations that allocate those costs to their grant, but they will need to at least show evidence of having made those administrative expenditures.

### When using statistical data do we have to reference where the data came from?

 Yes, data sources are requested, however, a full citation is not necessary.

### I am waiting for my SAM.gov to be verified as well as for my CAGE number.  Can I still apply for the R3 Funding opportunity?

 Yes, you may still apply. These items are not verified until the very end of the process, so there is time during application review to complete those steps.

### I am unaware of who owns the more durable office supplies that we purchase such as computers and the like. So, I guess that is one question: who owns the supplies, the company or the State of Illinois? 

If it is the State of Illinois: at the end of the grant cycle do we turn over supplies (or equipment) to the State; and when turning over supplies does the data contained in a hard drive (for example) belong to the State?

 For these grant funds, there is a distinction made between equipment and supplies. Any item over $5,000 per unit is considered equipment and would need to be inventoried as required by the grant. If the grant is terminated before the equipment depreciates in value to less than $5,000, and the equipment is no longer used for the purposes of the grant, the state may retrieve it.

Items that cost less than $5,000 (most computers and pretty much all regular consumable office supplies fall into this category), are considered supplies. Supplies are owned fully by the grantee and cannot be recovered by the state without evidence of fraud, waste, or mismanagement. 

 ### We have a DUNS # but our SAM # is expired information lapsed during previous organizational leadership, therefore we are not sure if we will be able to get all of the federal requirements in line before the due date for R3. Is there anything that we can do to be able to still apply if we are waiting on updating our SAM information?

 Yes, you can still apply. The status of the DUNS/SAM ID is not verified until the last stage of the review, so it does not need to be completed in time for the application due date. Please use the ID (even if it’s expired) to complete the information, and continue to work with SAM.gov to get it up to date, but in the meantime you are welcome to continue with the application submission.

 ### I am trying to complete the Programmatic Risk Assessment (PRA). Can you tell me where I can access an "Agreement Number" requested in the Certification section?

 You can leave the ‘agreement number’ question of the PRA blank. The form is used for both NOFOs and for established grants. Only established grants need to enter an agreement number.

 ### Am I able to give my accountant access to the grant portal so she can complete the budgetary requirements of the application? Can she get her own account and access the application, or can I give her my user name and password?

 Only the account that created the application can access that application in the system. We recommend either working on the application along with your accountant using your login information or having the accountant contribute their portion outside of the system (in a spreadsheet or word processing document, for example) and then you as the user simply entering that information. For security reasons, we do not recommend sharing your user name and password with another person since that means they would have full access to the application and may be able to enter information that you do not directly have control over into that application.

 ### We are looking to expand services as well as increase capacity for a greater caseload with these R3 funds in our application. Our Program Managers as well as our Program Director provide direct supervisory support as well as program service delivery to our clients and families. Would each of these supervisors be eligible to fund under R3? Are they eligible at 100%? For example, our program managers will be taking on new roles and leadership responsibilities should we receive R3 - in addition to their current roles, which are 100% direct service / allowable. Are they able to fund at 100%? Our Program Directly is more like 75% allowable in her role as she engages with all of our programming, supervises all program staff, and provides direct services herself with students and families - though 25% of her time is at the leadership level, including strategic planning and staff development, etc. Is this Program Director eligible at 75%?

 We have instituted no caps on the allowability of direct program staff (other than the requirement that no staff exceed 100%). Your estimation of the percentage of their time spent on the R3 program is the preferred way to allocate their time and effort in the budget. The same guidance applies to all staff, from supervisory/program directors to frontline program staff. As such, if these percentages represent the actual time and effort they would be spending on the program, they would be allowable in your budget.

 ### I am the Director of Development and Community Engagement for my organization. I will be responsible for this grant management. In reading this above, how do we determine the amount to fund within my role / salary as the grant manager? Is it 10% indirect cost based on my salary, or something else?

 For positions such as these, you should determine if it is possible to allocate the percentage of your time and effort to the R3 grant program itself. If so, please do so as described above. If it’s not, your costs would be captured in the indirect cost category instead. For this, you do not need to directly allocate the percentage of your time, but you would be able to capture only up to your allowable indirect cost rate. The calculation of the indirect cost rate is explained in a bit more detail in the recording of the budget webinar located on the Resources page at [https://r3.illinois.gov/resources]( https://r3.illinois.gov/resources). The decision is not something I can tell you for certain, but comes down to whether your role can be allocated between programs.

 ### My organization has an ongoing Youth Development program. None of our current program staff providing these services are funded directly, and we receive no state or federal funds. We are doing our best with general operating costs. I would like to know (a) can we apply for funds to support existing program staff who are not funded directly by anything; and (b) may we apply for funds to provide salary increases to any or all of our program / direct service staff to be competitive and support a living wage in line with the current economy?

 You may apply for funds to support existing program staff or bring on new staff. The salaries paid must be in line with your organization’s policies. You are not able to simply give increases to staff outside of your organization’s personnel policies just because of the existence of grant funds, but you may offer increases as allowed in your policies to existing staff (such as for increased duties and responsibilities, extended hours, etc).

 ### We are paying a monthly rent for our current facility and space, which is 100% in use for program and service delivery. This is not funded directly by any funding sources - we are pulling from general operating to cover these costs. Will the full cost of rent be allowable given that the full space is for program use and service delivery - and if not, how do we determine and provide evidence of the prorated amount?
 If the facility will be used entirely for the R3 program proposed in the application, then the full rental costs for the building would be an allowable cost for this application. If it is used for other programs and services apart from R3, you would need to prorate it using a standard allocation method (i.e. allocate the cost by number of program participants, square footage used by the different programs, FTE of program staff, etc). Evidence of the reasonableness of the allocation methods will be evaluated during the grant agreement development phase if your program is funded.

 ### Can you submit one application that has two different program priorities (for example, a program that has components of both Youth Development, and Workforce Development)?

 Yes. All applications must describe programs that address at least one of the five R3 Program Priorities, but can address more than one.

 ### I will be submitting one or more service applications. Our service is a technology-based fully remote training solution (accessible by phone and internet) service. It requires many individual positions to provide the service, without limit, coders, database managers, videographers, video editors, graphic design, and the like. All of these positions work to provide the service. I watched the budgeting video and the list of possible indirect costs included roles such as these. While such would be ancillary to most services, in our case the service can not be provided without these positions.We intended to have them on staff and not be sub-contracts. Can these be considered direct costs?

 Yes, if the time and effort of these individuals can be directly attributed to the R3 program, they are eligible to be included as direct costs. They should be budgeted in the personnel section based on the percentage of time they spend on the program itself in that case.

 ### I have my il.gov account, AmpliFund portal access, DUNS number, SAM, etc. but just learned that grantees need a grants.gov account to qualify. What is that and how do I get it?

 A grants.gov account is not a requirement to submit the application. A grants.illinois.gov account is required for AmpliFund access, but if you’ve already received your access then it’s likely you’ve already reached that step. As long as you’re able to access AmpliFund and submit the application, you have the necessary access. If you’re not yet able to fully gain access, you’ll need to go to [https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/](https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/) and select the “Create Account” button.

 ### My organization is applying for the service delivery grant for the R3 applications, and we are working on a collaborative application with different community organizations in and around our service area. My question is: do all organizations or groups on our application need to be GATA certified if the leading agency (us) is already certified?

 No, only the partner submitting the application in the AmpliFund system needs to be fully GATA-qualified. However, any collaborative partners who will be receiving grant funds through the program need to be minimally qualified to receive state funds (in other words, they will each need to have a DUNS number, maintain an active SAM.gov account, be in good standing with the Illinois Secretary of State, and not be on the State Stop Payment List.

 ### We plan to be a subcontractor for another organization. Are they able to apply for the grant and list us as sub-contractors?

 It is allowable for you to be a subawardee/collaborative partner on a different application submitted by another organization. They may apply and list you as a subcontractor or subaward depending on the services provided.

 ### I have much of my own equipment needed to complete the proposed program. However, new equipment supplies will be needed. Should I include my supplies as in-kind? Or leave that out?

 No in-kind supplies are required, and neither in-kind donations or matching funds should be included in your budget. The budget should give a good picture of the actual operating costs of the program and should ensure that it contains the amount needed to operate the program.

 ### If I operate a home-based business and I do not wish to seek rent payment from the grant is that allowed? Am I required to rent office space when my program does not require in-person meetings?

 You are not required to include rental costs in a budget if those costs are not part of your program. You are also not required to maintain office space if that is not a necessary part of your program.

 ### If an employee is being paid a full salary and has to take up another vacant position in the company can they be paid for multiple jobs? Other than the individual's physical capacity to do the work, are there any limitations to the number of positions/jobs a single individual may hold?

 A single individual cannot be budgeted higher than 100% of a full-time equivalent position across any state-funded programs (either multiple R3 programs if funded or other state-funded programs if applicable).

 ### My organization is applying in multiple areas with the same program and staff. If say a director is budgeted for $100,000 /yr. on a single application, is that person to receive 300,000.00 if 3 applications are awarded? If not, how do we account across 3 proposed budgets for compensating that individual for triple the workload?
Conversely, if we were to put in 3 applications and state that the director was paid $100,000 but 33% for each of the applications, and only one application was approved, is that director now only to receive 33,333/yr?
In other words, how do we compensate for increased work when there are multiple grant awards? How do we formulate that into the many proposed budgets?

 This is a great question, but unfortunately much of it would need to be decided by your organization as you are discussing your program within the application. What I can say is that each application you submit should identify a fully-formed and feasible program. You should not, for example, submit a budget with a key staff member at only 33% if you are aware that this role will require 100%. It’s important that your budget accurately identify the costs of the program, because if your program is funded it will be funded at the amount requested, which aligns with your budgeted amount. Keep in mind that if multiple applications in different regions are submitted, they may not all be selected for funding. If they are, it would be your organization’s decision to accept (and find a way to fill those roles) or to decline any awards you are not able to carry out within the budget of the award.

 ### Are student stipends allowed as part of the budget? These would be cash incentives to students as part of the program's apprenticeship component for timely completion of projects, engagement in sessions, and group or individual presentations or performance.

 Yes, such stipends can be allowable if they are necessary and reasonable for the proposed program. Your budget narrative and program design should identify the reason for the stipends. The stipends should be tied to specific outcomes.

 ### Our reentry program includes activities establishing community gathering spaces in communities where are participants will be returning such as art galleries, etc. We have found that many potential spaces require a lot of work to make them hospitable. How should we proceed with the grant application if programming is dependent on the timeline of space renovation?

 You should propose a feasible timeline in your application. Programming is scheduled to begin on July 1, 2022, but each program is different. If there are preparations that need to take place before service delivery can begin, please account for that in your implementation schedule and your program description.

 ### Are there other things we should be aware of as we write this application, since we have not yet rented and renovated the space (but will soon)?

 Just be aware that, while renovation is an allowable cost if it is reasonable and necessary for the program, such renovation is not allowable if it dramatically changes the value or the exterior configuration of a building.

 ### Besides quotes and plans, what are other requirements in this application for a build-out project—e.g. permit requirements, contractor licensing, etc.?

 This application does not require such documentation, but depending on the level and type of renovation they may be required when activities begin. You would be responsible for meeting any state, county, or local requirements for such renovation such as licenses, permits, etc. Note that fees or costs for such permits and licenses could potentially be an allowable cost.

 ### Does serving the R3 population inside prison qualify as serving the R3 population?

 Yes.

 ### How much of the funding can be set aside for general operations costs that will make this specific programming possible?

 I believe you’re referring to indirect costs (overhead/administrative costs that are not directly attributable to the program). If so, that can vary. If your organization has a negotiated indirect cost rate agreement, that agreement will identify your allowable indirect cost rate and base. If not, you may claim the de minimis rate of 10% of the MTDC base (which includes most direct costs but excludes some costs such as rent and equipment). For more information on indirect costs, please view the budget webinar located under the heading of “NOFO Informational Webinars” on the R3 Resources website at [https://r3.illinois.gov/resources]( https://r3.illinois.gov/resources). 

 ### The FY23 ICQ is not yet available in the GATA portal. Is there someone we should reach out to, to ensure we are able to get it submitted in time?

 Please just make certain that the most recent ICQ available is completed, and ensure that you complete the FY23 ICQ when it is available. You won’t be disqualified by the lack of an ICQ that is not available at the time of application.

 ### Is it possible to preview the Program Questions without going into AmpliFund? Can they be found on the R3 website?

 Yes. The questions included in the application can be accessed without needing to log into AmpliFund by clicking on the “Apply Now” button for the NOFO you’re interested in on the main page of the R3 website at [https://r3.illinois.gov](https://r3.illinois.gov). That button will take you to an AmpliFund landing page that contains some green buttons at the top right. To apply, you’d click the “Apply” button, but if you only wish to see the questions, you can click “Download” instead. This button will download a PDF that contains the questions you’ll be asked. Please note that this removes some of the functionality written into the system, especially on the basic information form, so it won’t look exactly the same, but it will allow you to view the Program Questions and Equity Questions that you will be asked.

 ### I inadvertently marked the budget tab "complete". How can I undo that action. Or do I need to start a new application?

 You do not need to start another application; you can just reverse the ‘completion’ of the existing budget. On the Budget section of the application, you should go down to the button that has been selected that says “Mark as Complete.” If you click that “Mark as Complete” button again, it will change to “Mark as in Progress,” which should allow you to return it to an in-progress work and allow you to continue editing the budget. Then just mark it as complete again when you finish.

 ### If you apply as a single organization (not as a collaborative), do you lose the 5 points associated with the following question: How many of the organizations in your collaborative are located in R3 zones? (5 points)

 No—if you apply as a single organization, these five points are instead based on your employees. Collaborative applicants only have the collaborative question and single organizations only get the employee question.

 ### How do the additional 5 points get assigned if you are applying as a collaborative, and some, but not all, of the collaborative partners are headquartered in an R3 zone. For example, if 75% of collaborating agencies are in an R3 zone, will they get all 5 points? What about 25% or 50%?

 If at least 50% of the collaborative partners are located in an R3 zone, the full 5 points are applied to the application. If fewer than 50% are, then no points are given for this question.

 ### Is there any conflict for recipients of a Community-Based Violence Intervention and Prevention (CBVIP) grant or are those organizations eligible to apply for a grant from the Restore, Reinvest and Renew (R3) program?

 No, there is no conflict or eligibility restriction. CBVIP recipients are eligible to apply for R3 funds. The only caveat is that you should not supplant those funds (in other words, if you are granted the R3 funds, you should use them to either expand or enhance your current program or to provide additional programs or services).

 ### We want to apply for the ICJIA R3 Service Delivery opportunity. In the portal the question on years of service provision says “Community Involvement - Select the option below that best describes the amount of time your organization has been involved with providing community services. (Northeast Central Region 2) *

We wanted to understand if the question is asking for years of experience in the specific R3 zone we are applying under, or more generally how long we have provided services as an organization.

 This question is asking in general how long your organization has been operating, not just within the R3 zone.

 ### The staffing section of the application has a table that seems like the same thing as the performance plan. Is it duplicative, or do we need to complete it?

 The implementation schedule may have some overlap with the performance plan, but it is necessary for the staffing section. The table should be filled out to show different steps your staff will need to take to carry out the program and ensure you have a plan to carry it out. Some items in the performance plan template may mirror this (particularly the ‘milestone’ metrics, since they are based on reaching a goal by a set date). However, others may not. This table can include process steps that are not included in the performance plan (hiring staff, reporting, etc).

 ### Our organization has paid off its building, but still pays utilities and taxes on the building where we would provide the proposed services in our R3 application. Assuming we request a percentage of these costs based on the percentage of the building the proposed R3 program would use, are utilities and property taxes considered allowable costs?

 Utilities and property taxes can both be allowable costs for this program. Building owners may also claim depreciation costs. These costs can be included as direct costs if there is a way to directly allocate all or a defined portion to the program, or as indirect costs if such clear allocation is not possible.

 ### The template in the grant application (p.34) is different than the link shared during the webinar. Which should we use? On the link budget version, there's no place for items such as client supports and furniture. Where should we place these items?

 The Excel template is just for preparation purposes and does not line up exactly with the system. You can include those costs on any direct costs page as you prepare the budget and then enter them correctly into the system. The budget within the AmpliFund system allows you to enter a range of different types of costs, just choose which category is most closely related and make sure you use the narrative field to explain it.


### We are applying for a R3 reentry Planning Grant and will be using a University, former reentrants, and community providers to help develop the process. The NOFO talks about MOUs and Linkage Agreements, can you please describe the difference?

Also there are about 25 community partners who will be participating to provide input. The NOFO indicates we need a separate Linkage Agreement with each one. If they are not receiving funding, can we just use an electronic signature page for the large group and have another with the University?

Same question for reentrants. Do they all need to sign separate MOUs/Linkage agreements?

Linkage Agreements between organizations confirm their commitment to the proposed project. However, only organizations that will be funded under the proposed program are required to sign them. No Linkage Agreement would be necessary from an organization that will provide input without funding support or from unfunded participants of the proposed program.

### In a single application, can we apply for multiple programs that would be operated by one organization? For example, we provide youth programming and prison re-entry services that don't overlap in a single program or department. Can we submit one application for funding for both programs? Or if not, can one organization apply for multiple programs in separate applications? Or something else?

Yes, you may submit a single application proposing to offer both youth programming and prison re-entry within the same region.

### Would a business that trains in financial literacy and compliments job training workforces be eligible for R3?

Yes. Businesses are eligible to receive R3 funds as long as the funds are used to carry out social service programs for R3 residents and communities. Financial literacy and job training are eligible for funding under the Economic Development program priority.

### May we include grant funds in our budget to provide stipends as incentives for attending group interventions? To pay client wages (20 hours a week) for the workforce development component of our program?

R3 funds may be used for stipends to encourage attendance and should be listed in your budget documents. Wage subsidies may be allowable if they are connected with specific program activities, such as skills training. This ensures participants are receiving meaningful benefits and are not simply being hired temporarily with subsidized wages. Wage subsidies also will need to be time-limited for the same reason and should end with the conclusion of the training or other program event. The needs for stipends or wage subsidies should be clearly explained in the context of the program goals.

### The R3 Planning NOFO states that grantees should develop a committee to provide input on the process. Are applicants required to specify potential organizations and/or provide MOU or something similar to confirm that we will have a relationship with the member? Our inclination is to list potential member pools (i.e., churches, youth groups) and determine specific partnerships after funding has been secured.

Planning grant applicants do not need to identify committee members in the application. Linkage Agreements are only required for collaborative applications.

### Where would we include citations for text box entries? I typically use UChicago footnotes. Should I attach a bibliography?

Citations are not required for your responses, but if you do cite sources, you can either include them within the text boxes at the end of your answer or attach a separate bibliography. The bibliography or cited sources will not be evaluated. Only substantive responses to the questions will be reviewed and scored.

### Is this just a one year grant or can multiple years of funding be applied for? We are trying to determine if the grant objectives should be for one year or three years.

Grant designations will support 12 months of funding. Enter grant objectives for one year. Future designations of up to an additional 24 months of funding support may become available. With a funding extension, grantees will have an opportunity to update their objectives to align with the extended period of performance.

### In reviewing Appendix C in the grant application portal, I'm not seeing where a document can be uploaded. Do the evaluation pieces get incorporated into the Goals, Objectives, and performance measurements? Or, are these developed only if grant funds are awarded? There is just a check off box that states an applicant has reviewed the content in the application.

Those documents are added in the “Performance Plan” step of the application phase. Appendix C is a resource for applicants as they develop objectives and measures and does not need to be completed. Simply check the box and then complete the Performance Plan.

### If our R3 Service Proposal wants to hire a contractor for a specific allowable purpose does the contractor need to meet any specific requirement such as DUNS, SAM, etc.?

Individual contractors do not need to meet those requirements. Vendors that are corporations or other business entities will require a DUNS number, SAM.gov registration, and good standing with the Illinois Secretary of State.

### If we are applying to serve 14 R3 zones in the Collar region with a max ask per zone of $490,820, is the max ask listed for one zone the same cap for a service area that covers 14 zones? Or is it compounded to a max ask of $23.5M?

The max caps listed are maximum amounts per region, not per zone. Applicants may request a maximum up to the total per region in each application. In your example, that means on your application to serve 14 zones within the Collar region, you can request up to $490,820 for the entire region and serve all 14 zones with that amount.

### The Programmatic Risk Assessment is needed for every applicant. Please elaborate on how it effects a new organization (less than 2yrs) vs established organization (more than 2yrs). It is my understanding that this form carries weight, so will points be deducted from a new company that may not have all protocols in place at the time of applying for R3?

The PRA is a required part of the application but is not a scored part of the application. No points will be deducted based on your answers to the PRA. The PRA is used internally to ensure that proper risk mitigation and support for grantees is in place when executing grant agreements.

### Can a charter school be eligible to apply?

Yes, if it meets the other eligibility criteria.

### Can we apply as a for profit with MOUs partners? Or would it be better to have the non-profit lead the application submission?

No preference will be given during application review in terms of whether a for-profit or nonprofit entity is the lead applicant. Both are eligible.

### Our organization would like to apply for both Capacity Building funding and Service Delivery funding. Can the capacity building grant run concurrent with our current service delivery and service delivery grant application?

Yes, if both are selected for funding, you would be able to concurrently operate both programs. Two separate applications should be submitted (one for each NOFO type), and there is no guarantee that both would be selected for funding.

### My organization is planning to apply for the R3 grant. We have an active DUNS number, are in good standing with the Secretary of State, and have a SAM registration. We are now working on GATA certification. My question is, do we need GATA certification as a precursor to submitting the grant application? Or, can we submit our application before being GATA certified?

A GATA account, not certification, is needed to create an AmpliFund account and complete and submit an application. However, applicants are encouraged to complete all prequalification steps needed for certification as soon as possible.

### My organization is a foundation that does not plan to carry out a project, but instead wants to apply for funds to pass the grant money through to other organizations who will apply to provide services in the community. We would ensure that our applicant organizations would provide services to R3 communities and satisfy all of the R3 requirements, but we think that our existing goals and networks would allow us to identify good service providers. We also work with our grantees to provide them with opportunities for growth and capacity building, which would be an additional benefit of our process. Can we apply for funding for this purpose?

Yes. However, your organization (as lead organization) must satisfy all funding requirements and a competitive selection process will be required to identify the subgrantees. All subgrantees must provide services in R3-eligible areas. Lead organizations must include a program design and performance metrics in their applications, with a clear description of services to be provided by the subgrantees.

### Is there a recording that can help me complete the Performance Plan within the AmpliFund system for this NOFO?

Yes. View the Creating a Performance Plan for the R3 NOFO recording here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH9_qRlMI4Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH9_qRlMI4Q).

All trainings have been recorded and are available here: [https://r3.illinois.gov/resources](https://r3.illinois.gov/resources).

### My organization just received funding for violence prevention through ICJIA. Are we still eligible to apply to expand our program using an R3 grant if we are already an ICJIA grantee?

Yes. Current R3 grantees may apply for R3 funds. However, current R3 grantees may not propose to provide services in the same region if they already serve as lead organization in another R3-funded program. In addition, for first-time lead organizations, new funding must be used to expand existing programs or services.

### What is the difference between the Planning & Capacity Building and the Service Delivery grant? Can an organization apply for both of them?

The Planning and Capacity Building NOFO offers funds in two areas. Planning funds will support organizations who want to bring together community stakeholders in R3 Zones to identify local needs, identify strengths and weaknesses or gaps in addressing those needs, and develop a plan to provide services to address those gaps. Capacity building funds support organizations as they build or improve their own internal ability to manage grant funds or provide services. This funding can be used for training, recruitment, staffing, or other needs an organization may have to start or improve their service delivery. Organizations may apply for grants to support planning, capacity building, or both in a single application.

The Service Delivery NOFO offers funding to organizations that will actively provide services in their communities. These grants will support direct services to program participants who live in R3 Zones. Funding may be used for program personnel, supplies, equipment, travel, and other costs that are related to a program of direct services to community residents.

Yes, organizations may apply for both types. Separate applications are required and will be individually evaluated for funding.

### Our organization wants to help clients who experience mental and behavioral health issues better connect with public benefits. To that end, we plan to hire mental health/social work/case management professionals to connect them to services. Since these would not be legal professionals, would this still qualify under the Civil Legal Aid program priority? Or will R3 only fund proposals for attorneys and legal staff to provide civil legal aid services?

Providing assistance in accessing public benefits to which a client is legally entitled would be a grant-eligible Civil Legal Aid service. Legal staff or staff attorneys are not required. However, staff budgeted for this role should be prorated appropriately in the budget if they provide services that are not related to the program. For example, if you hire a mental health professional who provides counseling services in addition to assisting clients in accessing public benefits, the counseling services would not fall under Civil Legal Aid and should not be included in the budget for that program.

### In the application under “Applicant Information”/ “Applicant’s Organization Unit” it asks for “Department Name”. Can you please further explain what information you are looking for here?

Some application questions are not applicable to all organizations. If the question is not applicable to your organization, feel free to leave it blank.

### We are applying to serve clients from three high-need R3 zones, but our general service area is larger than that. The funding we would request would then be tied to the number of the children we serve specifically from those three areas, right? If so, can you provide me with the zip codes for those areas?

The funding for this program is not necessarily awarded on a per-client basis. Instead, budget and program descriptions should list costs necessary to carry out the entire program. Consider your estimated number of clients in R3 Zones to be served by your proposed program as you create your budget.
Go to [https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility) and use the map to find the R3 Zones you propose to serve as a starting point for determining ZIP codes in your service area.

### As a way for an organization to increase its capacity for launching a large-scale service delivery program in the near future (e.g. re-entry program), Is it possible to utilize the capacity building portion of the R3 grant to staff, pilot and evaluate a smaller-scale service delivery program? 

Yes, carrying out a pilot project and subsequent evaluation to determine if the project should be carried out on a larger scale is within the scope of the Planning & Capacity Building NOFO.

### Are subgrantees allowed to be a part of an R3 application submitted by a single agency? In other words, if my organization applied as a single agency would we be able to engage additional organization partners as subgrantees, through an RFP selection process?

Yes, that would be allowable. Your organization will be required to conduct a competitive selection process to identify those subgrantees.

### What is the economic development money used for?

Economic Development grants may be used to support programming, such as personnel and fringe, supplies, equipment, travel, contractual, indirect, and other costs necessary and reasonable to provide an economic development program. Economic development programs may include job readiness and workforce development trainings, improvement of community shared spaces, training and support for local entrepreneurs, and other services.

### Could the funds be used to operate a community space where startups rent office space?

This is potentially allowable. Applicants must describe how grant funds will be used to provide services or benefits to the community above and beyond the rental costs that would be paid for the space.

### Can the R3 funds be used for both capital and operational costs?

Funds can be used for operational costs to run a program and some equipment costs that are reasonable and necessary for the program. R3 funds may not be used to support capital expenditures for the purchase of real property, such as buildings or land, or the construction or significant renovation of property.

### Do you have to have GATA? Please explain what GATA is?

Applicants must create an account in the GATA grant management portal at [https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/](https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/) before accessing, completing, and submitting an application. Collaborative partners on a collaborative application do not need this account.

### Can R3 be used to acquire space?

R3 funds may be used to rent space, but not to purchase property, such as a building or land.

### Who are the decision makers and can we receive a full list of committee?

R3 Board members are listed here: [https://r3.illinois.gov/board/](https://r3.illinois.gov/board/).

### When will an organization be awarded the grant?

ICJIA anticipates making grant award announcements in May, with the grant period to begin July 1, 2022.

### What does it mean to be minimally eligible for state funds?

To become minimally eligible, applicant organizations must have a SAM.gov account and a DUNS number and be in good standing with the Illinois Secretary of State. In addition, they must not appear on the State of Illinois Stop Payment List.

### How labor intensive is the application?

The application has been streamlined to help ease the process for potential grantees. That said, a number of questions must be answered to assist application reviewers as they evaluate the grant proposals. Get started on the application as soon as possible to ensure plenty of time is available to complete and submit it before the deadline of March 1, 2022, at 2 p.m.

### What if I don’t have my 501c3 status?

501(c)(3) status is not a requirement for application.

### Please let me know where I can find the link to access the program requirements for the R3 Service grant NOFO. Is it possible to find out the program requirements without going into the actual submission porta?

Yes. Go to the R3 NOFO INSTRUCTIONS AND APPENDICES section at [https://r3.illinois.gov/resources](https://r3.illinois.gov/resources).

### Will R3 cover public transit and/or private rideshare (eg. Uber, Lyft) fares for client transportation for appointments, court dates, social services, screenings? To clarify, we also wanted to include rideshares since some clients might not live near public transportation.

Yes, transportation costs are allowable if the need for the cost is justified within the program’s design and budget.

### While our main office is not located in an R3 zone, we will be collaborating with a subrecipient within an R3 zone to provide housing and support services. For the questions related to equity, do we include demographics and information about our collaborator/subrecipient?

Yes, please provide demographics and related information on all collaborative partners when answering the equity questions. When answering local preference questions in the PROGRAM QUESTIONS section, please only provide this information as it relates to the primary applicant.

### Is there a required minimum number of goals and objectives that should be listed for grant proposed activities under the service delivery grant?

No. However, listing objectives and performance measures for each of your proposed activities will help application reviewers evaluate the strength of those objectives within in the proposed program.

### Are costs to hire and engage an outside evaluator an eligible cost?

Costs to hire an outside evaluator may be eligible if an evaluation is reasonable and necessary to carry out your program. Outside evaluators may be more applicable to a planning and capacity building grant than to a service delivery grant, but in either case the reason for the evaluator should be justified in the context of the program design.

Also, ICJIA’s R3 Research Team is carrying out its own external overall R3 program evaluation. Applicants should describe the specific purposes of their proposed program evaluation for funding consideration.

### Is an outside evaluation required for this grant?

No. However, grantees may be asked to participate in the R3 Research Team’s statewide evaluation of the program, funded by ICJIA.

### Under additional performance metrics appendix C- required by the grantor listed for specific categories, under violence prevention it has if applicable to your program. Could you please explain applicable to your program? Is this defined by us up front or is this defined by ICJIA after review of the application based on our program design etc.?

“If applicable to your program” is a prompt for you to choose only metrics that apply to the program you are proposing. Some metrics listed may not relate to your program design. The applicable metrics are selected/defined by you up front and should be related to the design of your proposed program. And yes, these metrics could change with grant approval and in discussion with ICJIA staff.

### In the submission of a collaborative program is an MOU required for all members of the collaborative even if they are not going to receive direct funds from this grant application?

All collaborative members included in the proposed program as budgeted subgrantees must submit a MOU.

### Is it within the scope of the NOFO to provide funds for general home repairs for needy families even though these families aren’t involved with the criminal justice system?

Yes. Such services may be provided to all residents of R3 zones with Service Delivery grant funding, as long as the proposed program serves as least one of the R3 program priorities: civil legal aid, economic development, reentry, violence prevention, and youth development.

### If an organization is a subrecipient of the previous R3 funding awards, can they be a lead organization in a collaborative pursuing funding or even apply for funding this round?

Yes.

### We have a teen program for youth ages 14-18 and serve teens from 25 different Chicago high schools. As I reviewed the map for areas approved to receive the R3 funding, I wasn’t sure if our community was included but because we serve teens from various communities, I wanted to know if we are be eligible to apply for this grant?

Yes. Any organization may apply as long as their proposed program’s service areas and/or residents are R3 eligible. Use the R3 eligibility map at [https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility) to locate where your participants reside or where services will be provided to determine grant eligibility.

### I am planning to apply as the responsible applicant organization for a collaborative. One of the organizations in the collaborative is headquartered in Indiana. Is this permissible or must they be located in Illinois?

Yes. Out-of-state providers may deliver services to communities in R3 zones.

### Are we still eligible to apply even though we would be only asking for funding for a small portion of our region that we serve? Our service area covers an entire county; however, there is only one city in that county that is an R3 zone. The city makes up most of our clients, but are we still eligible even though we cover other areas that aren’t R3 zones?

Yes. However, the proposed program should serve only the R3-eligible area.

### Is there a limit or any additional restrictions around how renovations may be included in our application budget? We are considering modifications to our waiting area to accommodate additional mental health and substance abuse services and take steps to ensure safety of employees and program participants.

Renovations are allowable costs if they improve the capacity of an existing space to offer the proposed program. Renovations are not allowable if they will dramatically alter the function or value of an existing space. The purchase or construction of real property also is not an allowable cost.

### If our re-entry program works with currently incarcerated prisoners nearing release to advocate for better discharge plans, do we calculate R3 eligibility using the prison’s address?

Many re-entry programs use the permanent residence of the program participant when it is available. However, for programs that work with individuals who are incarcerated, that may be challenging. In that case, it is acceptable to use the prison address. Be sure to note it in the Program Design portion of the application.

### The Peoria Park District is considering applying to operate a program at one of our facilities that would primarily serve residents within R3 zones. However, the best facility for this program is located just outside of an R3 zone (but surrounded by them). I’ve included a photo below to demonstrate the situation.

The areas shaded in orange are R3 zones as designated by the State of Illinois. The black outline is the boundary of the Peoria Park District, which includes nearly all of the R3 zones in Peoria. The green dot is where we have a facility that we’d like to consider operating programming with R3 funding. This program would draw participants primary from R3 zones, without being located in an R3 zone itself. The nearest R3 zone is located 0.5 miles away from the facility.

I am wondering whether 1) our application would be considered if we made the case that this facility served mostly residents of R3 zones or 2) our application would be scored very negatively because the facility in question is not located in an R3 zone? If you think it is unlikely we might receive funding for a program in a facility outside of an R3 zone, we would consider alternative options that may be less efficient but located in an R3 zone.

Applications may receive fewer local preference points if the applicant organization is not headquartered in an R3 Zone. However, any organization may apply as long as their proposed program’s service areas and/or residents are R3 eligible. Use the R3 eligibility map at [https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility) to locate where your participants reside or where services will be provided to determine grant eligibility.

### I have a question about allowable expenses on the R3 Service Delivery NOFO. Will participant stipends/incentives be allowable on this grant budget? For example, we have a workforce development program where we provide stipends for participant attendance. Would that be an allowable program expense?

Yes, stipends and incentives for participants are allowable if they are reasonable and necessary for your program design. If selected for funding, additional documentation may be required to ensure stipends and incentives are appropriately monitored.

### If our ask is $145K, can ICJIA come back and offer a different amount?

Applicants may receive awards that are less than what they requested. In that event, applicants must determine whether they can make budget and other adjustments to their proposed programs before accepting their award.

### Is the amount for salary/hourly for the entire grant period? So If I am calculating an hourly wage, I would put the number of hours equal to the grant period, correct?

Yes, that’s correct. Include total salary costs for the entire program period in the proposed budget.

### Can the lead agency be a school or school district?

Yes.

### Are there character, word, or page limits to the questions or to the application overall?

No.

### Can photos and graphics be added to the application?

The AmpliFund system allows for photo and graphic uploads, however, documents, photos, and graphics that are not specifically requested by or required of the NOFO will not be scored.

### For our proposed program, facility improvements and the securing of a teaching facility will be necessary. Does R3 funding allow for facility developments?

Renovations can be allowable costs if they improve the capacity of an existing space to offer the proposed program. Renovations are not allowable if they dramatically alter the function or value of an existing space. The purchase or construction of real property is not an allowable cost.

### Does R3 funding allow for the purchase of teaching materials and equipment?

Yes, if these costs are reasonable and necessary for the proposed program.

### Does R3 funding allow for transportation and temporary lodging to participate in a training program for staff and participants?

Yes, if these costs are reasonable and necessary for the proposed program.

### We are looking to expand our program, and we are planning to do so in three phases. The proposal we want to submit for R3 is for the first phase of the expansion. Does R3 funding allow for funding an initial phase, when future phases and funding will be required?

R3 Planning and Capacity Building NOFO grants will support program development and expansion. The Service Delivery NOFO allows for an initial phase of program expansion, assuming services are offered as part of that expansion.

### We are having trouble translating the instructions for creating performance measures given in the Appendices to the form in AmpliFund. Will there be more information or some examples that can help with this?

Yes. Web training on Creating a Performance Plan for the R3 NOFO was held Thursday, January 27, 2022, at 10:00 a.m. You can view the recording of the training at the following link: [https://youtu.be/yH9_qRlMI4Q](https://youtu.be/yH9_qRlMI4Q) .

This webinar recording and associated slide deck are also available here:  [https://r3.illinois.gov/resources/](https://r3.illinois.gov/resources/)

### Our organization is not located in an R3 zone, but a large portion of the clients we service do reside within R3 zones. Since not all of the clients we service reside in R3 zones, should we prorate our funding by the proportion of R3 clients to non-R3 clients?

The guidelines of the R3 program do not require that grantees provide address checks for clients to ensure they are residents of R3 zones. It is sufficient for programs to provide services centered around the eligible R3 zones.

That said, if you have the ability to distinguish your clients based on residence and can prorate costs in that manner, you may use that information to demonstrate a benefit of your proposed program in the application (cost-effectiveness, local focus, etc).

### Will a budget template be provided to help us create the budget that we will then enter into AmpliFund for our application?

A sample Excel budget template can be accessed here: [https://r3.illinois.gov/resources/](https://r3.illinois.gov/resources/). The template may be used to develop a working budget. The information entered in the working budget must then be placed into AmpliFund.

### Which section of the budget should I use to input payroll taxes and insurance?

Payroll taxes and insurance costs are most commonly entered separately into the budget’s Fringe Benefits section. Some organizations’ payroll services offer reports that do not list a salary breakdown that includes payroll taxes and insurance. If you are not able to separate the payroll taxes and insurance from an individual’s salary, please enter the total salary amount into the Payroll section.

### Our population of focus has high mobility. Do we select the zones where we provide services?

Yes.

### What age range does R3 use to define “youth” for this grant?

R3’s establishing legislation offers no set age range requirement for the Youth Development program priority. Youth Development proposals should reflect the general spirit of the R3 program, which seeks “to treat violence and address the social determinants of health or promote community investment.” Applicants should identify the age range of focus for their proposed programs and explain how their programs will serve address those goals.

### Some organizations are operated out of peoples’ homes and do not have a business address apart from the home address. Will that be looked down upon in the R3 application or for preference points?

All addresses—both residential and business—will be evaluated for local preference. The application will be scored on the strength of the proposal, not the existence of a devoted business address or lack thereof.

### Can funding be used to provide direct home repair grants to low and moderate income households under economic development?

Yes. R3 funds may be used for general home repair. However, they may not be used to pay for construction that would dramatically change the structure, function, or value of a building.

### Regarding the Illinois R3 Service Delivery Grant, who should Letters of Support and Linkage Agreements be addressed to?

Letters of Support are not required for this application and will not be reviewed. Linkage Agreements should be established with documentation between the primary applicant of the collaborative and the collaborative partner.

### Would you please let us know how much total funding is available per funding region per Tier? We see the Tier ranges but would also like to know total dollars available to help us determine our request amount.

The maximum will depend on your tier and the funding opportunity for which you are applying. You can see the total available by clicking on your region of the eligibility map here: [https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility). The total within each grant region is the maximum amount that can be requested by an applicant.

### I am interested in your grant but not sure if I qualify. I am a small business that hasn't made a lot of money---really very little and I'm the only employee right now. I was just wondering if I had a great idea, if you would fund on the basis of that only or do I need to have made a significant amount of money? Also, do I need more than one employee?

There are no rules preventing small businesses (either in terms of revenue or in terms of employees) from applying for this grant. If you have an idea for a program that is in line with the goals and program priorities of the R3 program, you are welcome to apply.

### Where can I locate the NOFO instructions and appendices A, B, and C described in the NOFO questions?

The instructions and appendices (A, B, and C) can be found within the application in AmpliFund in the NOFO Instructions section. You can also find them under the NOFO Instructions and Appendices section here: [https://r3.illinois.gov/resources](https://r3.illinois.gov/resources).

### Can a newly-established organization (non-for-profit) apply for this funding? What about an LLC?

Yes, newly-established organizations are eligible to apply. LLCs are also eligible. This funding opportunity is open to for-profit businesses, established nonprofits, new nonprofits, faith-based organizations, and local units of government.

### Can my organization apply to both types of grant (Service Delivery and Planning & Capacity Building)?

Yes, organizations may apply for both types. Separate applications are required and will be individually evaluated for funding.

### I am interested in being a reviewer for the R3 applications. Are there any eligibility requirements to be a reviewer? Also, how much of a time commitment is anticipated? How many applications do you expect reviewers to go through? I am trying to gauge what is involved in being a reviewer, including any training or workshops before and after the March 1st deadline.

Training time is estimated at about two hours. The volume of work expected and time commitment may vary based on how many reviewers we have, but reviewers can expect to review between five and eight applications with each taking approximately an hour of review time. For more information on what is required for R3 grant application reviewer, and to register, please click here:[https://icjia.illinois.gov/news/join-our-volunteer-reviewer-pool/](https://icjia.illinois.gov/news/join-our-volunteer-reviewer-pool/).

### The equity questions ask for descriptions of ”real-life situations” of how agency leaders and front line staff have used their roots in the community to improve the organization’s programming (leadership) and improve their works with individuals in the community (front line staff). Must examples be specific to the program for which we are requesting funding, or can they be representative of the broader programs that serve our community? Similarly, must the “community to be served” story be specific to proposed program and neighborhoods in the R3 zone only? I ask the question because our organization serves a “community” including but larger than those in the R3 zones, ie those that would be the target audience for the proposed program.

These questions can be answered in terms of your organization’s (and collaborative partners’) overall service provision. It is understood that organizations may be serving areas broader than their specific R3 zones. You may include examples of experience garnered within those broader areas as long as they clearly relate to or encompass the program types and eligible areas discussed in the NOFO.

### For the awarding of local preference points, the application asks for our headquarters or main office location. We are a statewide organization with regional administrative headquarters throughout the state and a statewide administrative headquarters in Chicago. If we are applying for a grant to provide services in East St. Louis and our regional main office is located in an R3 zone but our statewide main office is not, should we include our regional headquarters office location? The regional main office is where all local work is managed and decisions are made. Our statewide office houses statewide infrastructure such as HR, IT, and Development.

There is much variety in how different organizations structure their local, regional, and primary offices. For uniformity, the local preference criteria is based on the location of the organization’s main headquarters. As such, please use your organization’s headquarters, not regional main office, for the local preference entry.

### If we apply as part of a collaboration, does the budget and longevity of the lead applicant determine which tier our application falls in, or is it based on each member of the collaborative?

Only the lead organization’s information is used to determine the tier in a collaborative application.

### Can a new Illinois non-profit organization that is not currently a formal 501c3 (IRS tax-exempt) entity apply for these funds? If so, must that step be in process at the time of our grant proposal submission (by March 1st)?

501(c)(3) status is not required to apply for these funds.

### How are R3 funds disbursed? It is reimbursement? Is there an opportunity for an initial disbursement of funds to begin programming? If it is only reimbursement, how is ICJIA working to create more equitable funding structures for organizations that don't have the capacity needed for a reimbursement setup?

R3 grants are disbursed using three methods designed to ensure that grantees have the necessary cash flow to carry out their approved programs without necessarily having the capital independently of their R3 grant award. They include:
Advance Payment: Grantees may elect to receive payment in advance monthly based on their ongoing expenditure projections for the quarter. ICJIA will evaluate requests for advanced payment to ensure that grantees meet certain administrative requirements.
Working Capital Advances: Grantees who are not eligible for advance payment plan may request a working capital advance that amounts to the projection of the first two months’ expenses, including startup costs. Following disbursal of the working capital advance, grantees will be paid via reimbursement of actual expenditures. Reconciliation occurs toward the end of the grant period to ensure that the grantee completes final closeout of the grant with a $0 grant balance.
Reimbursement: Grantees who do not require advance payment or a working capital advance are paid via reimbursement of actual expenditures.

### My organization is eligible to submit under several funding regions. And I see in the NOFO that it is acceptable to submit one application per eligible funding region. Can you please describe the review process across the various funding regions? For example, if we submit 2 separate applications for 2 different funding regions, would our applications each be reviewed by different individuals? Or are all applications from an organization reviewed by the same individual/group?

Applications for each region are reviewed separately by different teams of reviewers. Be aware that since funding competition occurs within (not between) regions, it is possible that an organization’s application in one region will be awarded funding while its other is not. This possibility may have implications for proposed program designs intended to cross regional boundaries.

### On the Basic Information page, do we have to select the R3 Zones for all of the neighborhoods where our participants come from? That'll be quite a few.

Yes, please list all R3 zones in your service area.

### Where can I view the recorded webinars for this grant opportunity?

The recorded webinars and the slide decks for the webinars are located on the website at [https://r3.illinois.gov/resources](https://r3.illinois.gov/resources) under the heading “R3 Informational Webinars.”

### I am having difficulty logging in to AmpliFund. How can I resolve this?

Please review the [AmpliFund Login Tip Sheet](https://r3.illinois.gov/downloads/LoggingintoAmpliFundAugust21.pdf) for log in steps:

This [Amplifund Walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONGy3XawjCA) also may be helpful.

For further assistance, please contact the Amplifund Help Desk at (216)377-5500 ext. 2.These resources and more are available at: [https://r3.illinois.gov/resources](https://r3.illinois.gov/resources).

### Is there a way to have a phone call with someone to discuss whether my organization’s work might fit in with this program?

Due to the competitive nature of the program, all questions must be formally submitted. To submit a question, send it via email to: [CJA.R3Questions@illinois.gov](mailto:CJA.R3Questions@illinois.gov). You will receive a direct response via email. All questions and answers will be posted here, in the FAQs.

### Are current R3 grantees eligible to apply for another grant?

Current R3 grantees are only eligible to apply either for new grant funding for programs proposed in a different region or under a different NOFO type to serve their current region. For example, current Service Delivery grantee mays only apply for a Capacity Building grant within the same region. Current grantees may apply as part of a collaborative, but cannot apply directly (as lead applicant) if they already hold direct funding within the proposed region.

### Is there an organization budget limit on this NOFO?

There is no restriction preventing agencies from applying based on the size of their budgets, but annual agency budget size is considered when grouping applicants into the set tiers.

There also is no predetermined grant award limit. The maximum amount that can be requested is based on a number of factors You can determine that amount by completing the NOFO’s Basic Information form.

### Can a current R3 grantee be a collaborative partner (not the lead) in the region covered by their original grant, but within a different R3 zone?

Yes, a current R3 grantee can be a collaborative partner on another application within the same region. They cannot serve as ‘lead’ on two applications/grants.

### Since we need to submit a requested grant amount for the application in AmpliFund before we get to the Basic Information form that tells us what our allowable amount range is, can we put in a placeholder amount first and change it when we know what the actual amount can be?

Yes. Just remember to revise that amount if it is determined the amount is outside of the allowable range or if the amount has changed for any other reason.

### Can our organization send in one application for Violence Prevention and one application for Youth Development in hopes securing at least one?

Organizations may not submit more than one Service Delivery application per region. However, you may submit a single application proposing to offer both Violence Prevention and Youth Development services. Organizations also may serve as both a lead applicant and a (non-lead) collaborative partner. This requires the organization to partner another applicant to perform any of the service types.

### I had a question regarding the Restore, Reinvest, and Renew (R3) Grants Program for Planning and Capacity awards and Service Delivery awards. Both of the provided NOFOs initially state the following:

"Applicants may be included in only one application submitted per funding region. In other words, if an organization is part of a collaborative submitting an application in one region, they may not submit a single application in the same region."
However, the NOFOs also state the following:
"Applicants may submit only one application per funding region. However, if an organization is part of a collaborative submitting an application in one region, they may also submit a collaborative application of their own or a single application in the same region." Just to confirm, may applicants submit both a collaborative and single application within one funding region?

Applicants may submit a single application and serve as a collaborative partner (not the lead/responsible applicant) in a second application within the same funding region. Applicants may not serve as single or lead applicant in two applications within the same region.

### In the application, there is reference to the term “agency.” Does that term refer to all parties in the collaborative or just the lead agency?

When answering questions about the responsible applicant on the application form, “Agency” refers to the responsible applicant alone—the organization submitting the application on behalf of a collaborative. It does not refer to all parties of the collaborative. When answering questions about the program (such as in the Program Questions or Equity Questions of the application, it can refer to the entire collaborative.

### Can this funding be used for services we’re already providing or do we have to apply for a totally new service?

These grant funds cannot replace other funding without an increase in service provision. Organizations must demonstrate either an expansion of current services or addition of new services to the current program. The proposed program must serve new or additional participants or provide enhanced or additional service to existing participants.

### Will businesses we contract with who may also appear on other applications be penalized? For example, if we use an online portal for hiring a certain population and someone else also purchases access to the same portal, will that disqualify both applicants?

No, there is no restriction limiting vendors from working for more than one grantee or applicant.

### Can a community receive funding for two planning grants, provided they are different topics?

Yes. If the two applications score highly enough to be funded, there could be two planning grants operating in the same community for different purposes.

### If were looking to hire a Grant/Fiscal Manager would that be allowable under the Planning and Capacity Building grant? Also, if I wanted to increase some staff’s salary to move them into a supervisory role, would that be allowable? If so, would that also be under the Planning and Capacity Building grant or the Service Delivery grant?

Hiring a Grant/Fiscal Manager and moving staff into a supervisory role with a salary increase is allowed both as part of a Service Delivery budget and as a Capacity Building grant activity.

### The instructions say to list the zone ID numbers for each R3 Zone our program serves. We serve all of Sangamon County. Do we list every zone in Sangamon County or just the zone where our office is located?

List every R3 Zone you propose to serve. If your service area covers the entire county, list all R3 Zones in that county. The table underneath the map at [https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility) will help you identify all R3 Zones in your county.

### If capital expenditures are not allowable costs, how do we interpret “investment in community infrastructure and housing?”

Some examples of such investment activities include providing workforce development opportunities in the community, repairing and remodeling community spaces, and finishing and supplying temporary housing for re-entering citizens.

### We were told that organizations that have annual budgets of less than $2.5 million are the only ones qualified to apply. Our budget is about $5 million annually. Can we apply for the R3 grant?

Yes. There is no restriction preventing agencies from applying based on the size of their budgets, but annual agency budget size is considered when grouping applicants into tiers.

### Our organization is relatively new and has not been fully funded. However, we are working with a very established partner. We are not yet sure who will be lead agency on the application. How do we determine the tier and thus how much we can apply for?

Your tier will be based on the annual budget of the agency submitting the application, combined with the length of time that agency has been operating. For example, if the agency submitting the application has been operating for two years or more and has a budget of less than $2 million annually, the application would be placed in the Tier Two category. The agency you describe may have a higher budget and be categorized into a different tier. The proposed service region is another variable in calculating the eligible amount. To determine your eligible award range, complete the Basic Information form within the application using the information you would use to apply.

### Are there any character or word count limits for the responses to the questions in Program Questions and Equity Questions sections?

There are no character or word count limits for the narrative questions in those application sections. We want to provide sufficient space for applicants to fully explain their programs. We only ask that applicants do so in a clear and concise manner.

### We are a current Assessment and Planning grantee and the end date for our program was extended to June 30. Since the new R3 Service Delivery applications are due March 1, does that mean we can no longer take advantage of the longer project period for the current grant?

No. This NOFO does not require completion of the Assessment and Planning process prior to applying for a new grant. Describing the planning process and any findings in relation to the Service Delivery program being proposed in your application would be sufficient.

### Does our program need to address a new scope of participants with this funding or can it be applied to an already established program?

These grant funds cannot replace other funding without an increase in service provision. Organizations must demonstrate either an expansion of current services or addition of new services to the current program. The proposed program must serve new or additional participants or provide enhanced or additional service to existing participants.

### Is this going to be a one-time funding source or will it be renewable?

These designations will support 12 months of funding. Future designations of up to an additional 24 months of funding support may become available.

### My organization has been in existence for over 20 years but has never received grant funds and never had a significant annual budget. Would the fact that it has been around so long put it into a tier competing with bigger organizations?

No. Organizations that have existed for longer than two years but have an annual budget of less than $2 million will be placed in Tier Two. The tier system was set up to ensure that longstanding community organizations with smaller budgets do not compete with larger organizations regardless of how long they have been operating.

### Is there anywhere to read on best practices and/or communities that have successfully implemented the R3 funding?

Visit this page for all available R3 research: [https://r3.illinois.gov/resources](https://r3.illinois.gov/resources).

### Are there specific definitions that showcase what would qualify for funding with the areas of Economic Development and Economic Disinvestment? Are there breakdowns explaining each area of focus?

The definitions are open to provide the flexibility needed to accommodate each community’s unique needs. Applicants are encouraged to propose programs that would best address the needs of their communities. While there are no specific definitions for those areas, the NOFO’s Appendix A (R3 Program Priorities) provides a brief explanation and examples of activities for each program priority area.

### Can we apply for both the planning and the implementation grant if we have a program ready to be provided, but would like to add elements and do a study to determine which elements are most needed in our community?

Yes, organizations may apply for both types. Separate applications are required and will be individually evaluated for funding.

### Can an application for an R3 Capacity Building Grant and Service Grant be submitted in the same R3 zone?

Yes, organizations may apply for both types of funding for use in the same R3 zone. Separate applications are required and will be individually evaluated for funding.

### Our organization had a question regarding letters of intent. I noticed that the previous R3 opportunity and many others provided by ICJIA have required letters of intent, however, I don't see anything in this NOFO requiring it. I just wanted to make sure that we weren't missing a deadline.

Notices of Intent were not requested for this funding opportunity. Applications are due at 2 p.m. on March 1, 2022.

### Is this Service Delivery grant for youth and adults? As I review the application details, I read information reporting "youth" service delivery. I do not see anything stating the word "adult" in the service delivery. I do see the word "client" in the service delivery sections.

Program participants served by Youth Development programs should be youth, but other types of programs under the other R3 Program Priorities can serve youth or adult participants depending on the needs of the community and the proposed program.

### Is there a charge to get an AmpliFund account or submit an application through the AmpliFund system?

No, there is no cost to register for or submit an application through AmpliFund.

### How should we read the word “agency” in the equity section? Does it only apply to the responsible applicant or to all members of the collaborative? Several members of our leadership team and the collaborative have lived experiences relate to our program.

When answering programmatic questions, including those in the equity section, please feel free to use the experiences of all members of the collaborative. However, please specify which organizations are being discussed so that the reviewers can take that information into account when considering how well the collaborative satisfies the equity criteria.

### Are R3 applicants also eligible to review the grant applications?

Yes, however, volunteers may not review their own organization’s application or any applications submitted by a direct competitor, such as organizations proposing to serve the same region or categorized within the same tier as the reviewer. Reviewers won’t be assigned to review applications from competing organizations. Reviewers must disclose all potential conflicts of interest.

## Eligibility

### Who is eligible for R3 grant funding?

Click <a href="/eligibility"> here </a> for a map and table of all eligible zones.

### Who decided the eligible zones?

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) in coordination with JEO and a diverse group of researchers that represent academic institutions from around the state performed the <a href="/resources#icjia-analysis">analysis</a> to determine what geographic zones satisfied the conditions established by the R3 legislation. These determinations were then approved by the R3 Board.

### How were the eligible zones chosen?

The legislation states that eligible zones should have the highest rates of: Gun injuries, Unemployment, Child poverty, Commitments to and returns from the Department of Corrections. The areas are designated by census tract. Census tracts are geographic areas defined by the Census Bureau. <a href="https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/geographies/address?form">Enter an address here to find its Census tract</a>.
You may also search an address directly within the R3 map search bar to find out if it is located within an eligible census tract.

## R3 Board

### What are the R3 Board's responsibilities and who is on it?

In addition to approving and delivering grant funds, the Board is responsible for developing a grant application, monitoring the grant process, and delivering an annual report to the General Assembly and the Governor. The R3 Board consists of the Lieutenant Governor, state agency leadership, and legislators. Additional Board members will be appointed to represent the areas that are eligible for R3 funding. These Board members will consist of elected officials, service providers, violence prevention experts, and people who have been directly impacted by incarceration.

### Do Board members get paid?

Board members are not eligible for compensation, except for reimbursement of reasonable expenses.

### How will the Board hold grantees accountable?

Grantees will be required to provide data and other information to the Board to ensure that grant funds are used effectively and efficiently.

### How much money does the R3 Board have to distribute?

The R3 program receives 25% of net tax revenue from adult-use cannabis and has been allocated $10 million for the 2020 fiscal year. Depending on the growth of the cannabis market, the R3 Board may distribute up to $125 million per year in the future.
