Opportunities for applicants to receive feedback on applications that were not selected for funding as a result of the recent R3 NOFO are still open. Applicants may request this feedback in writing to [Shadynna.Redmond2@illinois.gov](mailto:Shadynna.Redmond2@illinois.gov) by no later than 2:00 pm on Wednesday, August 31. When submitting your request for feedback, please make sure to let us know:

- The name of the organization that applied for funding,

- Whether the application was for Planning & Capacity Building or Service Delivery,

- Which region of the state the application was submitted, and

- The email we should send the feedback to.

If you have already submitted a request to receive feedback on your application, please do not resubmit. We have received a large number of requests and are working through them in the order they were received. We apologize for the delay due to the high volume of debrief requests, but expect that all applicants will receive their feedback by the end of September.
