### New R3 Application Deadline: 2:00 p.m., Tuesday, March 8

Due to an unprecedented response to the R3 Notices of Funding Opportunity, ICJIA has extended the application deadlines to 2:00 p.m., on Tuesday, March 8, 2022. This extension will allow agencies more time to complete and submit their applications and address any technical issues that may arise.

Agencies that have already submitted their applications may withdraw them and use the extra time for additional review and revision. However, withdrawing a completed application will require agencies to create a new application and copy and paste previously submitted responses to it. New/revised applications also must be submitted by the deadline of 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday, March 8, 2022. Withdrawn applications that are not resubmitted will not be considered.
